Purpose.  To issue Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) training guidance for all Navy \npersonnel.  TCCC is the Department of Defense (DoD) standard of care for all first responders, \nboth medical and non-medical personnel.  References (a) and (b) mandate the use of \nstandardized TCCC training.  Reference (c) directs the sole use of Defense Health Agency’s \n(DHA) TCCC trauma skills curriculum for all “Service trauma skills currently taught in first aid, \nself-aid, and buddy care courses.”  Reference (d) establishes TCCC as a pre-deployment \nrequirement.  References (e) and (f) updates reference (c) guidance and timelines. \n \n2. Applicability \n \n \na. The requirements in this instruction apply to all uniformed Active and Reserve \nComponent Navy personnel. \n \n \nb. Standardized TCCC curriculum developed by the DHA replaces all Service first aid, self-\naid, buddy care and field trauma training.  The curriculum published by the DHA for each of the \nfour role-based TCCC training tiers represent the minimum learning objectives for certification \nto ensure training standardization across the Services.  Additional topics may be added to meet \nService, mission, platform, or unit-specific requirements.  In line with reference (f), existing \ncourses should be updated to use the standardized DHA curriculum by 30 June 2021. \n \n \nc. Four TCCC tiers provide role-appropriate curriculum for personnel. \n \n \n \n(1) TCCC Tier 1.  All Service Member (ASM) training is designed to provide basic, \nevidence-based lifesaving skills for non-medical personnel at their duty stations or in preparation \nfor non-combat deployments. \n \n \n \n(2) TCCC Tier 2.  Combat Lifesaver (CLS) TCCC training is primarily for designated \nnon-medical personnel tasked to provide additional medical support within their units during \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOPNAVINST 1500.86 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 Apr 2021 \n \n2 \nsustained combat or contingency operations.  Examples where TCCC Tier 2 training may be \nappropriate include:  stretcher bearers, flying team, Emergency Medical Assistance Team, and \nselect personnel in expeditionary or security units. \n \n \n \n(3) TCCC Tier 3.  Combat Medic or Corpsman training is intended primarily for medical \npersonnel, to include some licensed medical practitioners.  Navy Hospital Corpsmen (HM) will \nreceive Tier 3 training and certification during their HM “A” School. \n \n \n \n(4) TCCC Tier 4.  Combat Paramedic or Provider (Advanced Resuscitative) TCCC \ntraining is primarily for advanced medical personnel, some licensed medical practitioners and \nselect non-medical personnel that may need to provide prolonged advanced field care for injured \nService Members (such as special operations and search and rescue forces).  Tier 4 TCCC \ntraining and certification will be included in the Recon, Surface, and Dive Independent Duty \nCorpsman (IDC) courses of instruction. \n \n3. Background.  DHA developed TCCC to provide evidence-based, lifesaving techniques and \nstrategies for DoD trauma care as directed in reference (a).  TCCC’s goal is to eliminate \npreventable deaths by ensuring all military personnel can provide lifesaving assistance for \nthemselves and others.  Reference (d) reduced reference (b), required TCCC training frequency \nto “Service discretion” and “pre-deployment.” \n \n4. Responsibilities \n \n \na.

Work with fleet and training stakeholders to program, budget and \naccount for the costs of implementing and sustaining the TCCC training requirements outlined in \nreferences (b) and (d).  DHA does not provide funding for TCCC training or training aids. \n \n5. General Policy \n \n \na. Individual TCCC training certification completion will be documented in FLTMPS.  \nCommand training departments or the training officer are responsible for recording locally-\ncompleted training in FLTMPS.  Learning sites will document student completion of course that \ninclude TCCC certification in FLTMPS.  The following CINs will be used to document \nindividual completion of DHA-approved TCCC curriculum: \n \nCIN \nCourse Title \nB-300-2010 \nTCCC Tier 1 - ASM \nB-300-2015 \nTCCC Tier 1 - ASM Refresher Training \nB-300-2020 \nTCCC Tier 2 - CLS \nB-300-2030 \nTCCC Tier 3 - Combat Medic or Corpsman \nB-300-2040 \nTCCC Tier 4 - Combat Paramedic or Provider (Advanced Resuscitative) \n \n \nb. Commands with rates and designators that do not typically deploy will periodically \nschedule role-appropriate (usually Tier 1 ASM) TCCC training opportunities for personnel with \nlimited or no deployment opportunities in their career.  Examples of service members with \nlimited deployment opportunity (based on the ratio of sea to shore billets) include:  Musicians, \nLegalmen, Naval Reactors Engineers and Judge Advocate General Corps officers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOPNAVINST 1500.86 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 Apr 2021 \n \n5 \n \nc. Higher Tier TCCC certification satisfies all lower Tier requirements (i.e. a Sailor with \nTCCC Tier 3 certification satisfies any requirement for TCCC Tier 1 or 2 certification). \n \n \nd. Personnel with any Tier of TCCC certification are qualified to teach the TCCC Tier 1 \nASM course after completing the online tutorials for trainers or attending an approved in-person \nTCCC train-the-trainer course.  DHA’s TCCC course and instructional material (course plans, \ntrain-the-trainer videos, etc.) are available at https://www.deployedmedicine.com/.  Learning \nCenters and their Course Curriculum Model Managers will determine TCCC instruction \nqualification policy and trainer or master trainer requirements as applicable. \n \n \ne. Personnel with TCCC Tier 3 or 4 certification may provide experienced TCCC \nproctoring (DHA required periodic oversight) for TCCC Tier 1 instructors. \n \n6. Records Management \n \n \na.
