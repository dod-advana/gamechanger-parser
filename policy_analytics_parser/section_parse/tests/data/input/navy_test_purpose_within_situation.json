Situation  \n \n    a.  Purpose.  In accordance with references (a) through (q) this Marine \nCorps Bulletin (MCBUL) establishes a codified, standardized, and repeatable \nprocess to identify, assess, prioritize, and reduce cyber-related risk in \nweapon systems and their critical supporting infrastructure.   \n \n    b.  Background.  The Marine Corps has completed the evaluations of cyber \nvulnerabilities on 23 weapon systems, including aircraft, ground vehicles, \nradars, command and control systems, intelligence systems, and artillery \nsystems in accordance with reference (a).  In a separate effort, the service \nhas evaluated installation infrastructure and Supervisory Control and Data \nAcquisition (SCADA) systems and identified the criticality of those assets \nbased on their support to Marine Corps missions, including support to weapon \nsystems, to meet the requirements of reference (b).  Multiple Marine Corps \nMCBul 3967 \n12 Jan 2021 \n \n2 \nentities conduct cyber-related risk analysis of specific assets – \ninfrastructures - and mission chains.  To maximize use of resources \nappropriated by the Marine Corps to accomplish the requirements  reference \n(c), the Marine Corps requires a process to unify efforts to systematically \nconduct cyber evaluations on critical capabilities and implement mitigations \nin a prioritized manner.  Given the expansive nature of the attack surface, a \ncohesive process is vital to ensure limited resources are effectively \ntargeted to address exploitable cyber vulnerabilities that directly impact \nmission success and combat preparedness in a cyber-contested environment. \n \n2.  Mission.  To effectively conduct Mission-Focused Cyber Hardening (MFCH) \nefforts in response to reference (d) through a comprehensive, effectively \ncoordinated, end-to-end kill chain risk assessment of critical weapon systems \nthat includes mission chain analysis, cyber threat and vulnerability pairing, \nenterprise-wide risk mitigation prioritization, risk reduction \nrecommendations, and strategies to increase the cyber survivability of \ncritical weapon systems. \n \n3.
