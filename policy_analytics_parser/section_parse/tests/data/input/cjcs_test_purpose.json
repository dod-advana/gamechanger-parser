Introduction.  The objective of the Joint Manpower Program (JMP) is to \nensure that joint activities have the minimum manpower with the appropriate \nskills and experience to carry out assigned missions, tasks, and functions.  \nThis enclosure describes the initial steps in the joint manpower process. \n \n2.  Components of the JMP.  The JMP has three principal components:  the \nJoint Manpower Validation Process (JMVP), the Joint Table of Distribution \n(JTD), and the Joint Table of Mobilization Distribution (JTMD).  Unless \nspecifically declared otherwise, all guidelines pertaining to the JTD also apply \nto the JTMD.  See Enclosure D for details on these documents. \n \n3.  JMP Process \n \n \na.  The JMP process is essentially a cycle following: \n \n \n \n(1)  The approval of joint manpower requirements and authorizations as \ndepicted in the JTD. \n \n \n \n(2)  The additions, deletions, and changes made to those joint manpower \nrequirements and authorizations. \n \n \n \n(3)  The mechanisms for translating the joint authorizations into specific \nService personnel assignment actions to fill the positions. \n \n \nb.  This process normally occurs through the steps depicted in Figure B-1.  \nSubsequent enclosures to this instruction address each step in detail. \n \n \n \n(1)  The JMP begins with the mission, which generates the nature of the \nspecific tasks and functions. \n \n \n \n(2)  The commanders and directors organize their commands to meet \ntheir assigned missions and determine the manpower requirements to carry \nout their missions within the established process and guidelines.  Enclosure C \nprovides guidelines for determining and validating joint manpower \nrequirements.  Manpower requirements must be coordinated with and \napproved by the Joint Staff and Services. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nB-2 \nEnclosure B \n \n \n(3)  Authorized joint manpower (i.e., authorizations) is a list of approved \nfunded manpower requirements contained in the JTD. \n \n \n \n(4)  The Services use the JTD to update their internal Service manpower \nsystems. \n \n \n \n(5)  Updated Service manpower systems feed data to the Service \npersonnel systems, which generate personnel assignment actions. \n \n \n \n(6)  Ultimately, personnel with appropriate skills and grades are assigned \nto approved positions. \n \n \n \n(7)  Unfunded joint manpower authorizations may be listed on \nCombatant Command and joint activities for no more than two funding cycles. \n \n \n \n(8)  Commanders and directors submit change manpower packages \n(CMPs) to make changes to their manpower requirements and authorizations.  \nEnclosure E provides detailed procedures for coordinating billet changes. \n \n \n \n \n(a)  These actions are \u201czero-balance\u201d actions because they realign \nexisting joint manpower positions to meet changing mission needs and do not \naffect the total number of joint manpower positions or the grade structure. \n \n \n \n \n(b)  The Joint Staff J-1/Human Capital Division (HCD) reviews and \ncoordinates CMPs with the Services and CJCS-controlled activities (CCAs) and \nadvises joint activities of their status. \n \n \n \n \n(c)  The initial focus of the Services\u2019 and CCAs\u2019 review of joint \nmanpower changes should be on determining if the skill, grade, and Service \nrequested are appropriate based on the billet description.  The Services and \nCCAs should then review their ability to resource the end strength, grade, and \nskill requested. \n \n \n \n \n(d)  If approved, HCD updates the JTD and informs the Services and \nCCAs in an \u201cimplementer\u201d to complete the joint manpower cycle. \n \n \n \n \n(e)  If the Service or Defense Agency cannot support the skill, grade, \nor Service, it should provide recommendations and alternatives  to help the \ncommand accomplish its mission. \n \n \nc.  Minor manpower changes known as \u201cautomatic\u201d changes may be \nsubmitted at any time.

Introduction.  The initial tasks in the joint manpower process are as\nfollows:\na. Define the command\u2019s missions, tasks, and functions.\nb. Determine and validate the manpower requirements.\n2. Organization, Missions, and Functions.  The initial step in the joint\nmanpower process is to define all the missions, tasks, and functions\nassigned to the activity by higher authority and establish an\norganizational structure to carry out these functions.  The organization\nstructure will be documented in the Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking\nSystem (FMTS) and is the basis for determining the manpower\nrequirements needed to perform the assigned missions.\n3. Guidelines for Determining Joint Manpower Requirements.\nStatements of manpower needs will be based upon approved programs,\nforce structure, and missions assigned by the Secretary of Defense and\nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Each joint activity will\nestablish its own internal system to determine joint manpower\nrequirements in accordance with the following guidelines (see Figure C-1):\na. Manpower requirements will be stated in terms of the minimum\nmanning required to accomplish the command\u2019s approved missions and \nworkload. \nb. Joint manpower requirements should be based on the average\nworkload expected to continue for at least 36 months.  Joint manpower \nrequirements should not be adjusted in reaction to temporary changes in \nworkload.  Short-duration taskings should be supported through \naugmentation, temporary duty (TDY) tasking, civilian overhire, or other \ntemporary solutions. \nc. Commanders and directors should satisfy manpower changes in\nrequirements associated with existing missions and functions by internal \nmanpower realignments and should submit updates with their annual fall \nchange manpower package (CMP) submission.  Such workload changes \nwill not be used as justification for joint manpower growth or an out-of-\ncycle request. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nC-2 \nEnclosure C \n \nd.  Joint activities should maximize use of support available from host \nServices and Service Components to prevent establishing internal \nfunctions that duplicate external support capabilities. \n \n \ne.  When requirements exceed authorized manpower levels due to \nexternal directives assigned by higher authority, joint activities may \nidentify unfunded requirements that should be submitted for funding \nthrough the PPBE process.  See Enclosure F. \n \n \nf.  Commanders and directors determine the Service for each position \nby considering the nature of the mission and geographic area of the \ncommand, total number of positions, military/civilian mix, grades \nrequired, and number of supervisory positions.  Rotational and \nnominative positions should be minimized to preclude problems in \nService programming for manning of rotational and nominative positions.  \nSee Enclosure H. \n \n \ng.  Manpower authorizations will not be adjusted to reflect the \npersonal characteristics or grade of incumbents. \n \n \nh.  Dual-hatting between a joint activity and a Service Component \nshould be avoided, except as directed for GO/FO positions as specified in \nreference a or agreed upon in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) as \na part of the host command or Component support to a Combatant \nCommand. \n \n \ni.  Dual-hatted positions will follow the guidance listed in Enclosure I. \n \n \nj.  Positions for assistants, deputies, executive officers, and advisors \nshould be limited to those directly supporting director positions.  \nPositions will not be authorized solely or principally for the purpose of \ntraining, career development, or Service balance. \n \n \nk.  Gender will not be specified for any billet unless required by federal \nstatute.  If a specific gender is required, it will be listed in the Special \nRequirements section of the Specific Information tab under FMTS Position \nData. \n \n \nl.  Joint activity manpower requirements may include positions outside \nthe Department of Defense, such as U.S. Coast Guard requirements or \nallied military requirements. \n \n \nm.  When joint activities submit CMPs that entail a change to a grade \nor critical skill code, they also will provide a short position description \nand rationale for the change request. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nC-3 \nEnclosure C \n \n \nn.  Internal reorganizations engendered by rotation of GO/FOs should \nbe handled through realignment rather than billet changes to ensure the \nincumbents do not lose credit on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL). \n \n \no.  The FYDP is uploaded to the FMTS Resource module not later than \n60 days after approval of the President\u2019s Budget (PB).  Any resulting \nchange to a joint activity will be submitted in the next CMP cycle or \nwithin 6 months (whichever is less). \n \n \np.  Other considerations applicable to joint activities are listed below: \n \n \n \n(1)  Structural Guidelines.  The standard organizational hierarchy \nwithin a headquarters (HQ) goes from commander to directorate to \ndivision to branch.  Each organizational element (i.e., division or branch) \nshould be broad enough in scope to encompass all related areas and \nmaximize the span of control of each major organizational element.  Two \nor more divisions are required to create a directorate, while two or more \nbranches are required to make a division; otherwise, the work center is \nmore appropriately identified as an office.  A division typically has no \nfewer than 15 positions, and a branch typically has at least four \npositions. \n \n \n \n(2)  Supervisory and Administrative Position Guidelines.  No deputy \npositions are authorized below deputy director.  No dedicated \nadministrative positions should be authorized for organizations below \ndivision level with less than 15 positions except to support a GO/FO \nposition. \n \n \n \n(3)  Senior Enlisted Advisor Guidelines.  There should be only one \ndedicated senior enlisted advisor in each joint command.  Additional \nadvisors/leaders may be represented on an additional-duty basis. \n \n4.  Defining and Documenting Joint Manpower Attributes.  Once \nidentified, joint manpower requirements must be defined in sufficient \ndetail to provide an effective target for the Service personnel assignment \nsystems.  See Enclosure I for data required to define a joint manpower \nrequirement in FMTS. \n \n5.  Civilian Positions.  The Service assigned as the executive agent (EA) \nadministers civilian positions at the Combatant Commands.  Civilian \npositions at other joint activities belong to the host, EA, or the \nagency/activity itself, depending on which organization programs for the \ncivilian end strength, affecting the grade ceilings and other constraints on \ncivilian positions. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nC-4 \nEnclosure C \n \n6.  Externally Controlled Joint Manpower.  This manpower category is \nallocated, funded, and controlled by a specialized resource provider for a \nspecific purpose and tracked by a special program element code (PEC).  In \ngeneral, the joint activities have very limited control over these positions \nas shown in the following examples: \n \n \na.  Intelligence.  Positions in this category are funded by the National \nIntelligence Program (NIP) or the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  \nThese positions are located in separate NIP and MIP activities and \nidentified by specific PECs.  Service intelligence positions are not \nexternally controlled.  The Joint Staff J-1 does not approve new \nrequirements for military and civilian NIP billets.  The Joint Staff will \nvalidate all non-NIP military intelligence billets via the JMVP and forward \nthem to the Office of the USD(I) for consideration.  During the Battlespace \nAwareness Program Budget/Review (PBR) deliberations, the PPBE process \ndetermines whether these requirements will receive funding or be \nforwarded to Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) for PBR \ndeliberations.  See Enclosure M. \n \n \nb.  Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs).  Most positions in \nSCOs are funded by title 22 (foreign military sales and foreign military \nfinancing administration accounts) or title 10 (operation and \nmaintenance) funding.  In specified foreign countries with which the \nUnited States has a treaty of mutual security assistance to provide \nmilitary advisors, trainers, technical support, and equipment, some SCO \npositions are partially funded by the receiving nation.  Specialized PECs \nare provided to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to \naccount for the title 22 security assistance funded billets:  PEC 1001xxx \nfor \u201cSupport to Other Nations.\u201d  SCO positions in other PECs are not \nexternally controlled and are approved by Joint Staff J-1.  See Enclosure \nN. \n \n \nc.  Special Operations Forces.  Positions in this category are funded \nand determined by USSOCOM.  See Enclosure O. \n \n \nd.  Defense Health Program (DHP).  DHP manpower constitutes most, \nbut not all, military medical manpower; combat support medical units are \nnot controlled by DHP.  DHP positions are closely funded, controlled, and \nmanaged by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)).  \nThese positions are identified by PECs beginning with \u201c08077\u201d (e.g., PEC \n08077XX).  Other medical positions are not externally controlled.  See \nEnclosure P. \n \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \nC-5\nEnclosure C \ne. Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).  The TWCF is a\nrevolving fund using a businesslike, buyer-seller approach.  U.S. \nTransportation Command (USTRANSCOM) staff and Defense Courier \nService (DCS) positions funded by the TWCF are in PECs 0408090DJT \n(Combatant Headquarters\u2013USTRANSCOM, DWCF) or 0408020DJT \n(USTRANSCOM Activities, DWCF), and consequently Joint Staff J-1 does \nnot approve new manpower requirements.  See Enclosure Q. \nf. Defense Acquisition Career Work Force.  These positions are not\nexternally controlled and have no special PEC, but Services must \ncoordinate with their respective Directors of Acquisition Career \nManagement.  See Enclosure R. \ng. Counterdrug.  Civilian positions in the Counterdrug Support\nprogram (begins with PEC 020114xxx) are externally controlled and must \nbe validated and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) \nCounterdrug Program Manager.  Joint Staff J-1 validates and approves \nmilitary positions. \n7. Externally Validated Requirements.  NATO Defense Manpower Audit\nAuthority is responsible for surveying, auditing, and validating all\nmanpower requirements within NATO peacetime establishment (PE)\nentities.  See Enclosure L.\n8. Joint Manpower Requirements Validation Process.  The following\nguidelines apply to those situations when external directives (i.e., POTUS\nor SecDef decisions) drive manpower requirements and the work cannot\nbe absorbed or the manpower needs resourced from new authorizations:\na. Requests should be submitted for the program years.  Current\nbudget year resourcing requests will not be addressed. \nb. Requests for joint manpower should be supported by the\nCombatant Command\u2019s integrated priority list (IPL), Joint Functional \nCapabilities Board (FCB) study, or Joint Quarterly Readiness Review \ninput.  Unsupported requests will not be considered without other \nindications of command priority. \nc. Requests for new joint manpower for Combatant Commands, CCAs,\nand other joint activities must be submitted to the Joint Staff for \nvalidation following the process outlined in Figure C-2.  Minor revisions to \nthis process will be annotated in the JMVP Guide.  Combatant \nCommands submit requests via memorandum to the Director, Joint Staff \n(DJS), early in the calendar year (CY).  Joint Staff J-1 will then convene a \nJoint Mission and Manpower Assessment Team (JMMAT) to analyze the \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nC-6 \nEnclosure C \nrequest and make recommendations to the Operations Deputies \n(OpsDeps) Tank.  The Tank decides whether or not to endorse the mission \nbrought forward by the Combatant Command for further resourcing \nconsideration (Figure C-3).  If not endorsed, the request is returned to the \nCombatant Command without action.  If endorsed, the request moves to a \nJoint Manpower Validation Board (JMVB) for sizing (attributes such as \ngrade, skill, quantity, etc.).  JMVB-validated billets are initially \ndocumented on the JTD/JTMD as unfunded requirements.  During PBR \ndeliberations, the PPBE process determines whether these the \nrequirements receive funding.  If funding for validated billets is not \nreceived within three PBR cycles, Combatant Commands will remove \nbillets from the JTD/JTMD via the standard CMP process. \n \n \n \n(1)  The JMMAT is led by the Director for Manpower and Personnel, \nJoint Staff (DJ-1).  Service, J-3, J-5, and J-8 representatives are the core \nmembers.  When a Combatant Command\u2019s new manpower request \ninvolves MIP intelligence skills, a Joint Staff J-2 representative will also \nparticipate.  MIP positions will be reviewed in conjunction with a JMVP \nsubmission and validated during the Joint Staff JMVP process.  The \nJMMAT is chartered with synchronizing planner-level input, analyzing \nand coordinating the Combatant Command manpower request while \nfocusing on the mission, and ultimately making recommendations to the \nOpsDeps Tank. \n \n \n \n(2)  The Combatant Commands requesting new joint billets are \nrequired to provide mission and billet offsets for the manpower request \nbefore a JMMAT will be conducted. \n \n \n \n(3)  JMVB membership consists of representatives from the \nServices, Joint Staff J-1/J-3 or J-5 (depending on the request), and J-8, \nwith each member allowed one vote.  The outcome of the JMVB is an \nimplementation memorandum signed by Joint Staff J-1. \n \n \nd.  Requests for additional manpower are generated from one of the \nfollowing actions (unless all affected Services concur via memorandum of \nagreement or otherwise): \n \n \n \n(1)  A POTUS or SecDef decision. \n \n \n \n(2)  The OpsDeps Tank process. \n \n \n \n(3)  An FCB study, generally supported by and culminating in a \nJoint Requirements Oversight Council memorandum. \n \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nC-7 \nEnclosure C \n \ne.  J-1/HCD maintains a JMVP Guide providing detailed instructions \non how commands must submit requests for new manpower.  This guide \nprovides information, charts, and templates to assist in explaining the \nentire manpower validation request process. \n \n \nf.  Combatant Commands will submit JTD/JTMD updates reflecting \nthe approved JMVP results to Joint Staff J-1 in accordance with the \nchange manpower process. \n \n \ng.  JMVP requests that are not supported by the OpsDeps Tank will \nnot be entertained during the next JMVP cycle unless significant changes \nto mission drivers or new SecDef or higher level guidance has been \nissued. \n \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \nC-8\nEnclosure C \nFigure C-1.

After manpower requirements have been determined \nand validated, they must be documented and forwarded to the Joint Staff \nfor review.  The Joint Table of Distribution (JTD) and Joint Table of \nMobilization Distribution (JTMD) are the statements of manpower \nrequirements for an organization to accomplish its assigned missions.  \nThis enclosure describes the elements of the JTD and the JTMD.  \nPrintouts of JTD and JTMD excerpts are shown in Figures D-1, D-2, and \nD-3 at the end of this enclosure. \n2.  Joint Table of Distribution.  The JTD is both a requirements document \nand an authorization document.  The JTD shows the funding authorized \nfor joint manpower requirements in the past fiscal year (PFY), the current \nfiscal year (CFY), and the next 5 program years in accordance with the \nFYDP. \n \na.  Manpower authorizations are the manpower requirements that \nhave been determined by an approved methodology; reviewed and \nrecommended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and \ncoordinated and funded or programmed for funding in the out years by \nthe Services and other resource providers. \n \nb.  Manpower authorizations are defined by program element code \n(PEC), Service, skill, grade, and any other position attribute required by \nthe Service personnel assignment systems (e.g., JDAL designation, \nlanguage, security clearance, advanced education). \n \nc.  The manpower authorizations in the JTD should be compared with \nService manpower allocations shown in their FYDP exhibits by program \nyear, PEC, and resource identification code (RIC).  Any disconnects must \nbe resolved. \n \nd.  The effective date of fiscal years (FYs) in the JTD and the JTMD is \n1 October.  This should not be confused with the position fill date or the \nestimated date that the position will be filled. \n3.  Annual Roll Forward of the Database \n \na.  By policy, manpower requirements and authorization change \nrequests submitted during the execution year will be processed for the \nbudget year, except under the following circumstances: \n \n \n(1)  Directed by OSD or program budget decision (PBD). \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nD-2 \nEnclosure D \n \n \n(2)  Directed via the resource decision process (RDP). \n \n \n(3)  Required for the JDAL. \n \nb.  The annual archiving of current manpower data during the \u201croll \nforward\u201d of the database to the next FY occurs at the end of the current \nyear.  FMTS allows changes to the data after it has been archived to \nhistory.  The appropriate Joint Staff J-1/HCD action officer will \naccomplish the manpower changes to history at each command. \n4.  Joint Table of Mobilization Distribution.  The JTMD is the mobilization \nequivalent of the JTD and is an integral part of the JMP.  There are two \ndifferences between the JTD and the JTMD:  the JTMD will have the \nmobility block checked (i.e., mobility equals \u201cY\u201d), and the RIC will indicate \na Reserve Component position with either drills (units or individual \nmobilization augmentee (IMA)) or other (IMA). \n \na.  A RIC with the word \u201cReserve\u201d or \u201cGuard\u201d and \u201cFull-Time Active\u201d in \nthe description but with mobility of \u201cN\u201d is an AGR (Active Guard Reserve) \nor FTS (full-time support) and will be listed on the JTD. \n \nb.

Introduction.  Changes in technology, missions, and the world \nsituation may lead to changes in manpower requirements.  The primary \nfactors in considering proposed joint manpower changes are the \nmanpower requirements that have been determined and validated as \nnecessary to accomplish new or maturing functions.  These requirements \nwill then be balanced against the ability of the Services to fund and \nprovide an individual with the desired grade, skill, or other special \nattribute required for the billet. \n2.  Types of Changes.  Proposed changes to the Joint Manpower Program \n(JMP) fall into the following categories: \na.  \u201cAutomatic\u201d Changes.  These are minor changes but represent the \nvast majority of the changes requested by joint activities.  Since \nautomatic changes do not require Service coordination, the joint activity \nmay submit a change manpower package (CMP) at any time and update \nthe FMTS database.  Figure E-1 lists the manpower changes that are \nconsidered automatic. \nb.  Changes of Service Concern.  These changes are not reflected in \nthe FYDP but are of great concern to the Services.  These changes should \nbe submitted via the semiannual CMP process, and contentious issues \nshould be resolved at the Service planner level.  Changes of this nature \nhave a more profound impact on the Services\u2019 planning and programming \nand, therefore, require scrutiny and management.  These changes include \nthe following: \n \n(1)  Changes to any skill code. \n \n(2)  Uncompensated grade growth. \n \n(3)  Mismatches between existing validated manpower \nauthorizations and the existing personnel inventory to fill those \nauthorizations. \n \n \n(4)  Positions that have been validated via the Joint Manpower \nValidation Process to add additional manpower requirements and \nauthorizations. \n \n \n(5)  Movement of incumbent billets between stations/installations \n(permanent change of station (PCS)) with or without permanent change of \nassignment. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-2 \nEnclosure E \n \n Changes to the following data elements do not require Service approval \n and will be processed as \u201cAutomatic\u201d changes in FMTS:\nDepartment\nBillet Title\nFluency\nSecurity Clearance Level\nUpdate Service Billet Identification (i.e., BIN, UMD)\nFunctional Code\nNATO Post Number\nRemark Codes (Schools, Experience, Off-sets, Other)\nRealignments within the same activity and:\n    No change in Grade\n    No change in Service\n    No change in Skill Code\n    No change in Subspecialty Code (SPCODE)\n    No change in Additional Code (ADCODE)\n    No change in PE Code\n    No change in RI Code\n    No increase/decrease in Funding Fields (FY05, FY06, etc.)\n    No change in SUIC; however changes \nin SUIC for Air Force  positions where the \nGEOLOC does not change will be \nprocessed as automatics\n    No change in JDAL Fields\n    No change in Nominative/Rotational Field\nNavy BSC\n* Detailed Job Description\n** Skill/grade changes to civilian positions that do not exceed \nallocated full-time equivalents.

Automatic Changes in FMTS \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-3 \nEnclosure E \n \nc.  Changes in Service Designation.  The most common changes of \nthis nature are requests to change the Service designation of a position or \nthe drilling category of a Reserve Component position because they \nrepresent changes in the contribution of each Service to the joint \ncommunity. \n \n \n(1)  These changes should be submitted and approved via the \nManpower Management System prior to submission via the semiannual \nCMP process. \n \n \n(2)  If the issue cannot be resolved within the CMP process, then \nthe RDP manpower procedures in Enclosure F apply. \n \nd.  New Missions or Organizations.  Use the procedures in Enclosure \nF to request additional manpower authorizations in support of new \nmissions directed by higher authority. \n \ne.  Fast Track Changes.  There always remains the option of \naccelerated processing to respond to events that require immediate \nchanges, such as force protection.  Designation of fast tracking requires \nthe consensus of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nServices and will follow the procedures in Enclosure F. \n3.  JMP Change Process.  Joint activities submit proposed changes via \nFMTS to the Joint Staff J-1 for approval and coordination with impacted \nServices.  Approved changes are posted to the JTD or JTMD; changes that \ncannot be supported are returned to the requester.  Joint activities \nshould notify affected Services upon approval of automatic changes to \nexpedite Service manpower documents.  Figure E-1 shows the basic \nprocess for submission and review of proposed changes to the JMP.  The \nspecific responsibilities for execution of this process are described in the \nfollowing paragraphs.  In accordance with reference ai, Combatant \nCommands, CCAs, and other joint activities will have two CMP \nsubmission cycles per year.  The first CMP cycle will begin in March and \naddress all programmatic actions.  The second CMP cycle will begin in \nSeptember and address all internal manpower realignments, billet \nattribute changes, and any nonprogrammatic actions. \n \na.  Combatant Commands, CCAs, and Other Joint Activities.  These \njoint activities submit the proposed joint manpower changes in a CMP to \nJoint Staff J-1.  JTD changes need to be submitted separately from JTMD \nchanges, as Joint Staff J-1 cannot batch such changes in FMTS \nseparately at its end.  Joint manpower change requests should: \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-4 \nEnclosure E \n \n \n(1)  Explain the specific manpower changes requested in sufficient \ndetail to allow Service manpower and personnel staffs to identify the \npositions to be changed. \n \n \n \n(a)  Combatant Commands will explain the overall justification \nfor manpower changes in the \u201cNotes\u201d section of the Position Change \nGroup Tracking ID screen. \n \n \n \n(b)  Combatant Commands will explain individual billet change \nrequests on the \u201cDetailed Change Reason\u201d link under FMTS CMP Position \nData. \n \n \n(2)  Establish the proposed effective date for the change.  Ensure \nsufficient lead time has been allowed for Service personnel actions (see \nFigure J-1) or FYDP programming actions.  Only changes of a highly \ncritical nature will be effected during the execution year.  Propose an \neffective date not less than 6 months from the submission date of the \nCMP for recommended changes during the execution year, or on a \nspecial-case basis (e.g., incumbent, nominative, or delayed programming \naction). \n \n \n(3)  Identify suitable offsets for changes with resource impacts.  \nPositions already coordinated and programmed for deletion are not \nacceptable as offsets because they have already been removed from the \nService FYDP. \n \n \n(4)  Include a rationale to justify the proposed change to the \nimpacted Services or other resource providers, and explain the potential \nimpact if the change is not approved. \n \nb.  Joint Staff (J-1 and DJS).  The Joint Staff J-1 will process all joint \nmanpower actions to provide management control of the joint manpower \nprogram and data system.  Joint Staff J-1 responsibilities include the \nfollowing: \n \n \n(1)  Review the CMP and determine if Service or resource provider \ncoordination is required based on the specific actions requested. \n \n \n(2)  Update the JTD or JTMD when no coordination is required; \nforward changes to the appropriate Service that will update its respective \nmanpower and personnel data systems accordingly.  Data element \nchanges listed in Figure E-1 do not require Service approval, so Joint \nStaff J-1 may implement them directly. \n \n \n(3)  Batch CMPs if coordination with the Services or resource \nprovider is required and forward for review. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-5 \nEnclosure E \n \n \n(4)  Review Service and resource provider comments and take \nappropriate action. \n \n \n \n(a)  When all activities concur, the Joint Staff J-1 approves the \nrequest, updates the JTD or JTMD, informs the requesting activity, and \ninforms the impacted Services through an implementer, so they may \nupdate their manpower and personnel data systems. \n \n \n \n(b)  When activities disagree, the Joint Staff J-1 leads the effort \nto reconcile inputs and reach a decision. \n \nc.  Military Services.  The Services review the proposed changes and \nevaluate their ability to fund the manpower requirements and staff them \nwith individuals who possess the requested attributes. \n \n \n(1)  The initial focus of a Service\u2019s review of proposed joint \nmanpower changes should determine if the skill, grade, and Service \nrequested are appropriate based on the position description listed on the \n\u201cDetailed Job Description\u201d link.  The Service should then review its ability \nto resource the grade and skill requested (or drill category, grade, and \nskill in the case of Reserve manpower changes).  If the Service lacks the \nresources to support the proposed changes or the request contains an \ninappropriate skill, grade, or Service, it should propose an alternate plan \nthat will help the command accomplish its mission with the available \nresources.  Alternatives could include grade substitutions (within the \nlimitations of the JDAL, the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, \nand the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act), skill or language \nsubstitutions, and interim security clearances. \n \n \n(2)  When assignment or programming lead times preclude \napproving the request as submitted, the Services should indicate when \nthe action could be implemented. \n \n \n(3)  When proposed joint manpower changes have been approved, \nthe Services will update their internal manpower and personnel \ndocumentation systems during the Service\u2019s next documentation update \ncycle. \n \n \n(4)  Services should return a planner\u2019s memorandum with a \ndetailed explanation if they do not agree with the changes proposed by \nthe Combatant Commands. \n \n \n(5)  The Services should support all approved joint authorizations.  \nHowever, mismatches sometimes occur between approved joint \nauthorizations and the Services\u2019 existing personnel inventory to fill the \nauthorizations.  The mismatch is more significant between O-3 and O-4 \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-6 \nEnclosure E \nofficer positions since this delineates the boundary between JDAL and \nnon-JDAL billets.  For those skills and grades that are critically short, the \nServices may coordinate a suitable substitution with the impacted joint \nactivity and the Joint Staff J-1. \n4.  General JMP Change Overview.  The following guidelines, together \nwith the CMP cycles (Figure E-2), the coordination matrix (Figure E-3), \nand the CMP process (Figure E-4) govern submission and approval of \nproposed changes to joint manpower requirements. \n \na.  Changes to joint manpower requirements for the CFY (i.e., the \nexecution year) must be held to the absolute minimum because they \nrequire redistribution of allocated resources and do not allow for training, \nrequisitions, and PCS moves.  These changes will be made only when \ndirected by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or on an exception \nbasis with the approval of the affected Services. \n \nb.  Proposed changes must comply with ceilings or floors imposed by \nCongress or the Secretary of Defense, such as those for major DoD HQ \nactivities or overseas troop strength ceilings/floors. \n \nc.  Proposed changes in skills, grades, or Service mix that would force \na personnel assignment action should be approved in FMTS far enough in \nadvance to allow for conversions to occur prior to the reassignment of the \nincumbent.  In general, Services require at least 9 months for personnel \nassignment actions after documentation of the JMP into their manpower \nsystems.  See Figure J-1 in Enclosure J for the lead times required by \neach Service. \n \nd.  Changes to joint manpower requirements for the coming fiscal year \n(i.e., the budget year) should allow time for requisitioning, training, and \nPCS moves. \n \ne.  A request for additional joint manpower should normally be \nworked through the RDP, which is linked to the PPBE as outlined in \nEnclosure F, and must be the result of external directives assigned by \nhigher authority (e.g., the President or Secretary of Defense) or included \nin resource management decision (RMD) guidance. \n \nf.  Proposed changes to joint manpower requirements should include \nidentification of suitable offset resources (i.e., offsets) for changes in \nauthorized strength, grades, and PECs.

All JMP changes that are not \nconsidered \u201cautomatic\u201d should be submitted semiannually, unless \nthe changes fall under Enclosure F guidelines.  Figures E-2 and E-4 \ndepict the semiannual JMP change schedule and process for joint \nactivities. \n \na.  Combatant Commands, CCAs, and joint activities have two \nsubmission cycles.  The first submission cycle will start in March and \naddress only programmatic actions.  The second submission will start in \nSeptember and address billet attributes, realignment, and other \nnonprogrammatic actions.  Exceptions to this submission policy will \nrequire justification from the Combatant Command/J1 to the Joint Staff \nJ-1/HCD Chief.  See Figure E-2 for the construct using a notional \nschedule. \n \nb.  To facilitate balancing of the Service FYDP against the JTD/JTMD, \nCombatant Commands must add/remove all programmed manpower \nduring the next CMP cycle following the programming action (RMD) \napproval. \n \nc.  Exception:  Requests for growth follow a different timeline and are \naddressed in Enclosure F. \n6.  Timing of CMPs \n \na.  Execution Year.  Execution year changes that are directed by the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or approved by the Services will be \nmade on an exception basis only. \n \nb.  Budget Year.  CMPs that affect the first budget year should be \nsubmitted during the first submission cycle of the CY.  Budget year \nchanges submitted during the second submission cycle reduce the \nServices\u2019 ability to support these requests.  Most CMP changes that do \nnot change end strength should be submitted with the effective date in \nthe budget year. \n \nc.  Program Years.  Submit CMPs that change joint end strength in \nthe program years (FYDP out years following execution and budget years) \nduring the first submission cycle after the approved programming/budget \ndocument (RMD) is issued. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-9 \nEnclosure E \n7.  Coordination Required for Joint Manpower.  The CMP Coordination \nMatrix, Figure E-3, outlines the basic coordination necessary to make a \nchange to joint manpower requirements. \n \na.  More coordination is required in the joint community than in the \nrelatively streamlined world of the Services.  Most billet attribute changes \nrequested by a joint activity must be staffed with the Services. \n \nb.  Unlike Service major commands, joint activities do not own their \nmanpower.  Although the Combatant Commands and joint activities have \nbeen granted primary military missions by law, they have not been \ngranted their own manpower budgets to manage. \n \nc.  Combatant Commands and joint activities control their own \nstatements of requirements based on assigned missions.  However, they \nmust coordinate with the Joint Staff, Services, or resource sponsor on \nmanpower funding and with the Services on personnel inventory issues. \n \nd.  Combatant Commands and joint activities will conduct a yearly \nreview of their respective JTD/JTMD with Service Manpower Documents \nto ensure CMP actions accurately reflect current approved authorizations.  \nDiscrepancy reports should be provided to Joint Staff J-1/HCD not later \nthan 30 days after review. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nE-10 \nEnclosure E \n \nPOSITION DATA  \nDEFINITION \nEXECUTION \nYE TION \nYEAR \nBUDGET \nYEAR \nPROGRAM \nYEAR(S) \n ORGANIZATIONAL DATA \n \n \n \n \nCOMMAND \nCommand \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n \nACTIVITY \nActivity \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n \nDEPARTMENT \nDivision, Branch, or Section \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n \nPOSITION NUMBER \nParagraph \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n \nTITLE \nPosition Title \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n \nSUIC \nService Unit Identification Code \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nLOCATION \nGeographical Location of Command \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \nCDR1 \n MANPOWER FUNDING DATA \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFUNDING \nAuthorized Strength \nOSD2 \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \n \nSERVICE \nAuthorized Service \nOSD2 \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \n \nSALARY PLAN (MIL) Officer, Enlisted,  \nN/A3 \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \n \nSALARY PLAN (CIV) Civilian \nCDR \nCDR \nCDR \n \nGRADE (MIL) \nAuthorized Grade Military \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nGRADE (CIV) \nAuthorized Grade Civilian \nCDR \nCDR \nCDR \n \nPE CODE \nProgram Element Code \nOSD2 \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \n \nRI CODE \nResource Identification Code  \nOSD2 \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS DATA \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPOSITION TYPE \nType of Position \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \n  Dual-hatted position \nDual-Hatted Position \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \n  Nom/Rot Position \nNominative/Rotational Position \nOSD2 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nSKILL (3) \nSkill/Specialty Required \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nJOB CODE \nOccupational DoD Code   \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n OTHER JOINT POSITION DATA \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERVICE BILLET ID \nService Position Number \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nFUNCTIONAL CODE Position Functional Code \nCDR 1 \nCDR \nCDR \n \nJDAL POSITION \nJDAL Position \nN/A3 \nJCS \nJCS \n \nJDAL CRITICAL \nCritical JDAL Billet \nOSD2 \nOSD \nJCS \n \nJDAL EXEMPT \n \n \n \nJCS \n \nESSENTIALITY CODE Requirement for military positions \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nCDR \n \nEMERG ESSENTIAL \nPosition required during emergencies \nCDR 1 \nCDR \n \nCDR \n \n \nACQUISITION \nAcquisition Requirements \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nSERVICE \n \nSPECIAL \nREQUIREMENTS \nSpecial Requirements of Position \nN/A3 \nSERVICE \nCDR \n \n \nNOTES \n1.

Introduction.  This enclosure discusses the linkage between the Joint\nManpower Program (JMP) and the PPBE process.  It also establishes a separate\nmechanism to manage requests for additional joint manpower.\n2. Overview\na. The JMP operates within an environment of limited resources.  Joint\nactivities must prioritize manpower requirements to fund the highest priority \nmissions. \nb. The resource decision process (RDP) creates standardized mechanisms,\nlinked to the PPBE, to address requests for additional joint manpower \nresources systematically as well as a process to reallocate joint manpower \nbased on a comprehensive review of requirements. \n(1) The RDP is designed to produce timely, implementable decisions on\nmanpower resourcing issues with full consideration of the comparative costs \nand benefits associated with these decisions. \n(2) It allows each request to be viewed within the context of overall joint\nmanpower requirements, provides balanced representation of all affected \nparties, and includes an appeals process. \n(3) The RDP reviews new joint manpower requests to ensure\ncompliance with business rules outlined in the DepSecDef-directed Combatant \nCommand management headquarters (MHQ) baseline. \n3. Resourcing Guidelines.  The following situations fall outside the RDP:\na. Work created by joint activities will be absorbed within their own\nresources.  Most \u201cmission creep\u201d that generates requests for additional \nresources will fall in this category.  Requirements for internally driven workload \nshould be supported by the normal CMP process with internal billet \nrealignments. \nb. Temporary work requirements will be resourced with short-term\nresourcing mechanisms such as TDY, augmentation (e.g., active duty \noperational support (ADOS)), civilian overhire, or other solutions that are \ntemporary in nature. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nF-2 \nEnclosure F \n4.  New Joint Manpower Requests \n \na.  Requests for new manpower (MHQ and joint subordinate activities) must \nbe mission-driven, POTUS-/SecDef-directed, and UCP-based (i.e., Joint \nStrategic Capabilities Plan, Guidance for the Employment of the Force, \nGuidance for the Development of the Force, or Global Force Management \nImplementation Guidance), or EXORDs, or as directed by NSPDs, laws, or \ntreaties, and cannot be sourced internally. \n \nb.  New manpower requests should be submitted in accordance with the \nJMVP outlined in Enclosure C, paragraph 8.  JMVB-approved new manpower \nshould enter the PBR process through a Combatant Command nominated \nissue paper and will compete for resourcing against Department-wide priorities \nvia an OSD-led manpower issue team. \n \nc.  Approximately November of the next FY, the Resource Management \nDecision (RMD) will be coordinated with all affected parties.  Every effort will be \nmade to ensure that all parties receive copies of the RMD and that the RMD \naccurately implements RDP results.  Normally, RMD-directed actions are \neffective for the next FY (budget year) and do not direct current year (execution \nyear) changes. \n \nd.  In December/January, the signed RMD will be distributed to all affected \nparties. \n \ne.  Combatant Commands will update the JTD and/or the JTMD via a CMP \nto reflect the results of the RMD within 45 days of receipt. \n5.  Resourcing Options \n \na.  When additional joint manpower requests are supported by the OpsDeps \nTank for resourcing from existing joint manpower, the Joint Staff J-1 and J-8 \nwill apply the following guidelines to determine the specifics of any reallocation: \n \n \n(1)  The manpower pool for reallocation normally includes the \nCombatant Commands and the Joint Staff. \n \n \n(2)  Several methods can be used by the Joint Staff J-1 to recommend \nresourcing candidates.  For example, a macro fair share reduction can be levied \nwith position-level details provided by the targeted activity.  Note that the \nrequesting activity will not be exempt from participating in reduction options. \n \n \n(3)  Reallocation normally will occur in the first program year. \n \n \n(4)  Reallocation may entail shifting of manpower from one joint activity \nto another as well as changing the Service mix among joint activities.  Example:   \nA new requirement called for 50 Army and 50 Air Force positions.  The \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nF-3 \nEnclosure F \ncommand tasked to provide the manpower could provide 100 Air Force \npositions but no Army positions.  Therefore, the command was reduced by 100 \nAir Force positions, 50 of which were then exchanged with 50 Army positions \nin other commands in order to meet the new manpower requirement. \n \nb.  When the OpsDeps Tank rejects internal offsets or reallocation, the \nService will be afforded an opportunity to comment on resourcing prior to \nforwarding a final request for additional manpower to OSD-CAPE. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nF-4 \nEnclosure F \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(INTENTIONALLY BLANK) \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nG-1 \nEnclosure G \nENCLOSURE G  \n \nFOURTH ESTATE MANPOWER TRACKING SYSTEM \n \n1.  Introduction.  The Electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel System  \n(eJMAPS) has transitioned to the Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking System \n(FMTS).  FMTS is a management information system and system of record that \nprovides an automatic method to coordinate manpower changes and track \npersonnel at the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, CCAs, and other joint \nactivities.  The capabilities of FMTS are discussed in detail in the FMTS User\u2019s \nGuide, reference c. \n2.  Purpose of FMTS.  FMTS allows the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, \nCCAs, and other joint activities to maintain, review, modify, and report \nmanpower requirements while providing a personnel database using manpower \nas the organizational structure.  Additionally, FMTS provides an interface to \nthe Joint Duty Assignment Management Information Center (JDAMIS) for joint \nofficer management. \n3.  Overview of FMTS.  FMTS has been designed to provide users with the \ncapability to manage manpower and personnel data.  FMTS is an automated \nsystem that performs the following functions: \n \na.  Manpower Requirements Management.  Provides a method to coordinate \nmanpower changes at the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, CCAs, NATO, \nand other joint activities. \n \nb.  Military Personnel Management Information.  Provides a method to store \nand report personnel information for individuals assigned to the Joint Staff, \nCombatant Commands, CCAs, and other joint activities. \n \nc.  Personnel Security.  Provides a method to store and report position, \npersonnel, and security information for the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, \nCCAs, and other joint activities.  As of the date of this guidance, this capability \nis only available for the Joint Staff.  However, the capability will be \nincorporated for Combatant Command use under the Phase II software release. \n \nd.  Managing Mobilization and Other Individual Augmentees (IAs).  Provides \na method to track and report the mobilization and individual augmentation of \npersonnel to the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, CCAs, and other joint \nactivities. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nG-2 \nEnclosure G \n4.  Technical Architecture and System Requirements.  As of the date of this \nguidance, the FMTS application is based on PeopleSoft Human Capital \nManagement (HCM) 9.1, using PeopleSoftTools 8.50.  FMTS resides in the Joint \nStaff Information Network SECRET (JSIN-S).  The JSIN-S network is a small \nnetwork providing limited client access to the SECRET Internet Protocol Router \nNetwork (SIPRNET).  The JSIN-S network provides external connectivity to the \neJMAPS user community (the Joint Staff, NATO, HCD, Military Personnel \nDivision, Joint Staff J-Code Military Secretaries, Joint Staff Security Office, six \nCCAs, Military Service Manpower Planners, and nine Combatant Commands). \n5.  Inputs.  Joint Staff, Combatant Command, CCA, and other joint activity \nmanpower inputs to FMTS consist of manpower requirements changes \nelectronically submitted to the Joint Staff that coordinate with the Services if \nthe inputs are not considered automatic changes.  If approved, the Joint Staff \napplies the changes to FMTS.  The Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, CCAs, \nand other joint activities interactively enter personnel data.  The Joint Staff, \nDefense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and the FMTS contractor enter inputs \nto the various validation and code tables. \n6.  Outputs.  FMTS allows users to specify such variables as where a process \nruns and in what format the process output is to be generated.  FMTS allows \nfour methods of output:  e-mail, file, printer, and Web. \n7.  System Security.  FMTS provides a secure, Web-based manpower and \npersonnel application for the joint community and the Joint Staff.  The \narchitecture environment is the Joint Staff\u2019s JSIN-S (classified Secret), which \nwill require the system to employ appropriate security features and measures \nto support the minimum-security requirements within the network \nenvironment.  This secure environment will be required at all user sites beyond \nthe Joint Staff via SIPRNET, establishing a common operating environment for \nall FMTS users. \n8.  Future Direction of FMTS.  The long-term objective of FMTS is to move \ntoward a functional and technical architecture where the environment, \ninfrastructure, and hardware are shared and integrated with other DoD \nsystems.  Future system development should strive for a dynamic, online \nsystem that: \n \na.  Provides access for all users at the appropriate level. \n \nb.  Standardizes terminology and data descriptors across the Services and \nall joint activities. \n \nc.  Permits appropriate users to access data elements and validation tables. \n \nd.  Provides appropriate users with standard reports and query capability. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nG-3 \nEnclosure G \n \ne.

Standard Organizational Elements.  The order and designation of \norganizational elements in FMTS will be as follows: \n \na.  Command.  The Joint Staff determines the available values.  The \ncommand code contains five characters:  the first code is an alpha character, \nand the second through fifth codes are numeric characters.  The command \ndescription can be up to 30 characters long. \n \nb.  Activity.  The Joint Staff determines the available values.  The activity \ncode contains five characters:  the first code is an alpha character, and the \nsecond through fifth codes are numeric characters.  The activity description \ncan be up to 30 characters long. \n \nc.  Department.  The department code can contain up to 10 alphanumeric \ncharacters, and the department description can be up to 30 characters long.  \nIncluded in the department organizational elements are division, branch, and \nsection, if required, with a different code assigned to each element. \n2.  FMTS Required Manpower Data Fields.  The following data fields must be \ncompleted to define a joint manpower requirement: \n \na.  Effective Date.  See Chapter One of the FMTS User\u2019s Guide for \ninformation about the proper use of effective dates. \n \nb.  Status.  There are two types of statuses on effective dated entries: \n \n \n(1)  Active.  The data row will be available for all users when they enter \ntransactions. \n \n \n(2)  Inactive.  Used instead of deleting a row.  By changing an effective \ndated entry to inactive (equivalent to deleting an entry for further processing), \nthe user is allowed continued use of this information for historical reporting. \n \nc.  Reason Code.  Enter the appropriate reason code for each position.  \nWhen updating a position, the reason code field is the only one required as it is \nassumed that all required fields have already been completed when a position \nis first added. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nH-2 \nEnclosure H \n \nd.  Position Status.  Will default to \u201cWork in Progress.\u201d  Shows status of \nposition (e.g., proposed, approved).  See FMTS User\u2019s Guide on how to change \nfrom \u201cWork in Progress\u201d to \u201cProposed\u201d status. \n \ne.  Title.  This field is automatically populated when the skill code or job \ncode is entered.  However, this field can be overridden to reflect the current \nposition title. \n \nf.  Position Type.  Required for each military position. \n \n \n(1)  Rotational Positions.  Rotational positions should be used only \nwhere a change of Service representation is essential to the performance of the \nmission.  Adjustments of planned rotational dates of incumbents in rotational \npositions should be coordinated with the impacted Service at least 9 months in \nadvance. \n \n \n(2)  Nominative Positions.  In the joint arena, nominative positions refer \nto military positions for which all Services are expected to submit nominations \nfor personnel assignment, but no single Service is designated to fill the billet \npermanently.  Since nominations occur in the execution year, Services cannot \nplan or program for these positions, causing chronic difficulties in planning \nand personnel assignment.  The use of nominative positions should be \nminimized because the Services cannot program for them. \n \n \n(3)  Dual-Hatted Positions.  A position requiring grade O-6 and above \nwith duties in two organizations (e.g., Combatant Command and one of its \nService Component commands). \n \n \n \n(a)  Position Type of \u201cDual Hat\u201d will be used for each position.  The \njoint position must list the Service Billet ID. \n \n \n \n(b)  If a joint command carries the position as its authorization, the \njoint command will list a \u201c1\u201d in each \u201cFunding Value\u201d block for each FY that the \nposition is funded. \n \n \n \n(c)  If the Service Component command carries the position as its \nauthorization, the joint command will reflect it as unfunded and will list a \u201c0\u201d \n(zero) in each \u201cFunding Value\u201d block for each FY that the position is unfunded.  \nIn such cases, the incumbent in the joint position is not eligible for JDA credit. \n \n \n(4)  NATO Posts.

List the appropriate PEC assigned to each \nbillet.  This allows tracking of externally controlled assets and compliance with \nMHCs and resource allocation decisions. \n \nj.  Resource Identification Code (RIC).  The RIC indicates the type of \nmanpower (e.g., military or civilian), the Service designation, whether the \nmilitary billet is active or Reserve, and, if Reserve, the funding level (i.e., \nnumber of drills) assigned. \n \n \n(1)  Each military position in a joint activity must be linked to a specific \nService to track funding and assignment responsibilities. \n \n \n \n(2)  Reserve drill category\u2014when applicable in the JTMD\u2014identifies \nwhether the billet is to be an individual mobilization augmentee (IMA) or part of \nan augmentation unit.  If the billet is to be an IMA, then identify the number of \ndrill periods required based on the training requirement. \n \nk.  Service Unit Identification Code (SUIC).  Enter the appropriate SUIC for \neach military and civilian position. \n \nl.  Service Billet ID (for Military).  Enter the appropriate Service billet ID for \neach current military position.  This provides the necessary crosswalk of each \njoint position to each Service database.

This field will be blank if position is new or if an Army position is \nmoved between activities.  On position moves, current Service billet ID must be \nlisted in the \u201cRemarks\u201d section.  This field will be completed after commands \nreceive updated Service documents in FMTS through an automatic change.  \nNavy equals BIN from Activity Manpower Document (AMD), and Marine Corps \nequals BIC from the Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS). \n \nm.  Funding Years.  The first year listed will be the PFY, the second year \nlisted will be the CFY, and the next 5 years listed will be the program years. \n \nn.  Funding Values.  Either a one or zero will populate each \u201cFunding Year\u201d \nblock to indicate if the position is funded (one) or not (zero) for each year.  The \naggregate of these values, along with SUIC, PEC, and manpower category, \nassists joint activities in resolving FYDP disconnects with each Service. \n \no.  Department.  List appropriate department.  Coordinate with Joint Staff \nJ-1 for new values. \n \np.  Location Code.  Location code is automatically populated when the \ndepartment code is filled in.  However, this code can be overridden.  Coordinate \nwith Joint Staff J-1 for new values. \n \nq.  Functional Code.  Identify the primary task associated with this position \nfrom the functional code, understanding that there are multiple tasks \nassociated with any billet at joint activities.  This code is a standard DoD code \nused for \u201cCommercial Activity\u201d purposes.  Coding for civilian positions should \nbe consistent with the official civilian position description. \n \nr.  JDAL Start Date.  Required only if JDAL position or JDAL critical \ncheckbox is checked.  JDAL positions\u2014those field grade officer positions that \nmeet the SecDef definition of a JDA as listed in reference b\u2014should have the \nJDAL position block checked.  The process for determining if positions comply \nis managed through the JDAL validation board.  Once the board has approved \na position for incorporation, the JDAL position block will remain checked and \nwill be designated as a JDA.  Additionally, those positions designated as critical \nJDAs must also be identified on the JTD.  The JDAL exempt block should be \nchecked if the billet is a \u201cJPME Phase II TDY Exempt\u201d billet, a position that is \nexempt from TDY and return requirement.  See reference b for more \ninformation on JDAL procedures.  Only the Joint Staff/Joint Officer \nManagement office updates this field in FMTS. \n \ns.  Salary Plan.   Fill in the appropriate military or civilian code.  Military \nand civilian positions are determined by RIC; salary plan is automatically \ncompleted based on the RIC selected. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nH-5 \nEnclosure H \n \n \n(1)  Military positions should be established when required by law, \ntraining, security, discipline, rotation, combat readiness, or when a military \nbackground is required for successful performance of the duties involved.  \nUnusual working hours, difficult working conditions, and avoiding overtime \ncosts are not appropriate reasons for using military positions. \n \n \n(2)  Civilian personnel will be used in positions that do not require \nmilitary incumbents for reasons of law, training, security, discipline, rotation, \nor combat readiness and do not require a military background for successful \nperformance of the duties involved. \n \n \n(3)  Military positions may not be used to replace civilian positions \ndeleted by reduction-in-force programs.  However, military personnel may be \nassigned temporarily to perform the functions of civilian positions when \nreduction-in-force programs cause temporary workload imbalances or mission \nimpairment. \n \n \n(4)  Consider the use of outsourcing for noncombat functions if it is \nmore economical.  However, contract services may not be used solely to \ncircumvent military or civilian ceilings.  In addition, any outsourcing of work \ncurrently being performed by military or federal civilians must be conducted \nthrough a competitive sourcing process as provided for in Office of \nManagement and Budget Circular A-76 and as mandated by federal law. \n \nt.  Grade.  Technical, supervisory, and experience requirements should \ndetermine the position\u2019s grade level. \n \n \n(1)  The position\u2019s grade must be consistent with the specific skill or \nspecialty. \n \n \n(2)  The joint activity\u2019s aggregate grade structure should be consistent \nwith mission requirements and Service grade ceilings. \n \n \n(3)  Although civilian grades are not normally tracked by a command, \nthis data field must be populated in order to be accepted by FMTS.  Civilian \ngrades are determined by the local civilian personnel office after analysis of the \nspecific position description.  Either the determined grade or two zeros must be \nlisted in this field. \n \nu.  Skill Code.  Identify the job skill required for in the position using the \nmilitary specialty code that best fits the position.  This data will be listed in the \n\u201cSkill 1\u201d field (e.g., designator, rating, AFSC, military occupational specialty \n(MOS)).  Identify the Navy officer billet classification code or additional skill \nidentifier (ASI) in the \u201cSkill 2\u201d field when required.  Identify the sub-specialty \ncode, second ASI, or special qualification identifier in the \u201cSkill 3\u201d field when \nrequired. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nH-6 \nEnclosure H \n \n \n(1)  Avoid such strictly limited definitions of requirements that the \nposition cannot be filled or fails to consider otherwise highly desirable \ncandidates. \n \n \n(2)  The job skill must be consistent with that found in reference f. \n \n \n(3)  Periodically, the Services will submit to all JMP activities an \nupdated list of skill codes that require special management, either because \nthey have such low density or because the requirements exceed the inventory. \n \nv.  Job Code \n \n \n(1)  In the case of civilian positions, commands should show the civilian \noccupational series in the \u201cJob code\u201d field. \n \n \n(2)  For military billets, the choice(s) listed in the drop-down menu for \njob code are dependent upon what code is entered for \u201cSkill 1.\u201d  Pick the most \nappropriate job code if two or more choices are listed. \n3.  FMTS Optional Manpower Data Fields.  The following data fields are \noptional when defining a joint manpower requirement: \n \na.  Essentiality Code (for Military).  Enter the appropriate code as to why \nposition must be the listed \u201cSalary\u201d plan or retained on the JTD/JTMD. \n \nb.  OGE (Office of Government Ethics) 450 Block.  Check if a confidential \nfinancial disclosure report is required. \n \nc.  SF 278 Block.  Check if an Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial \nDisclosure Report is required. \n \nd.  Specific Information.  Identify any unique attributes of the requirements \nnot readily apparent from the skill/specialty for the position, such as \nexperience, schools, special requirements, language skills, regional expertise, \nsecurity clearance requirements, whether the position is a key position, and \ngender (when a specific gender is required).  Such attributes should be closely \nscrutinized since each additional attribute makes the position exponentially \nmore difficult for assignment personnel to fill. \n4.  Classification of FMTS Reports \n \na.  Per DoD 5200.1-R, resource reports will be classified SECRET.  As a \ngeneral rule, all other documents will be classified UNCLASSIFIED.  However, \nselect reports will be classified at a higher level due to the nature of the \nactivity\u2019s function, as determined by the command and through coordination \nwith Joint Staff J-1/HCD and the Services.  JTDs, JTMDs, JTD-Ps, and  \nJTMD-Ps for certain Combatant Command activities will be classified SECRET. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nH-7 \nEnclosure H \n \nb.  Documents that use names and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) (e.g., \nJTD-Ps and JTMD-Ps) for data retrieval are subject to the Privacy Act and must \nbe properly annotated as determined by each command.  The following phrase \nmay be used on such documents:  \u201cThis document may contain For Official \nUse Only (FOUO) and/or Privacy Act Information which must be protected or \nremoved prior to further disclosure.\u201d \n5.  FMTS Production Support Staff (PSS).  The PSS assists the Office of the \nUnder Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness, Information \nManagement (USD (P&R)IM)) and Joint Staff J-1 in supporting and maintaining \nthe production release of FMTS.  PSS is responsible for Tier II and Tier III \nsupport functions during core business hours, 0700-1900 EST/EDT, Monday \nthrough Friday.  Tier level support functions include the following: \n \na.  Tier I.  The first line of customer contact, logging, user information \ngathering, and initial troubleshooting.  An Office of the Chief Information \nOfficer (OCIO) contractor currently provides Tier I help desk support. \n \nb.  Tier II.  The second level of support with the FMTS PSS technical staff \ncontacting the customer for troubleshooting on user-reported problems.  For \nusers outside the Joint Staff, communication will be via telephone and/or  \ne-mail.  Calls that cannot be resolved by Tier II support will be referred to \nFMTS Tier-III support. \n \nc.  Tier III.  The third level of support is referral from the FMTS Tier II \nsupport when a more specialized eJMAPS technician is required.  An FMTS \ntechnician is defined as a PeopleSoft HCM V8 application specialist, an FMTS \nhardware specialist, or an FMTS custom application specialist.

Introduction.  Once a manpower authorization is approved and forwarded to \nthe Services, the length of time it takes for the person to report to the \ncommand varies from Service to Service and depends on the time of year.  This \nenclosure describes the requirements, limitations, and critical milestones of \neach Service\u2019s system to help joint activities improve the timing of their \nmanpower change requests. \n \na.  The entire process usually takes 13 to 22 months from the date the \nmanpower change request leaves the joint activity until the new individual \nreports for duty.  See Figure J-1. \n \nb.  Figure J-2 shows the equivalent terms and essential steps for each \nService. \n2.  Army Manpower and Personnel Process.  The following are critical elements \nin the Army\u2019s programming, budgeting, and manpower process. \n \na.  The Structure and Manpower Authorization System (SAMAS).  SAMAS \ncontains the authorizations at the military identity (officer, warrant officer, and \nenlisted) and Army PEC level. \n \nb.  The Army Authorization Documents System-Redesign (TAADS-R).  \nTAADS-R applies to the Total Army\u2014Active Army, Army National Guard, Army \nReserves, and civilian workforce.  The Army uses TAADS-R to record changes \nin the requirements and authorizations that result from changes in unit \nmissions, organizational structure, and equipment. \n \nc.  The Personnel Management Authorization Document (PMAD).  The \nPMAD contains the authorized skill and grade detail for Active Component \npersonnel distribution.  The PMAD is top loaded by the Deputy Chief of Staff \nG1 to project requirements into the program years.  The PMAD is updated \nsemiannually (based on the Army G-3 LOCKFORCE) to reflect what is in the \nArmy\u2019s SAMAS and TAADS-R files.  The Updated Authorization Document is a \nperiodic update to the PMAD. \n \nd.  The Dynamic Distribution System (DDS).  Since there are more officer \nrequirements than resources, the Army developed an Officer Distribution Plan \nfrom the PMAD to distribute Active Component officer resources.  The Army\u2019s \njoint manpower policy is to fill JDAL positions at 100 percent and the \nremainder of joint positions at the Army average for a particular skill and \ngrade. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nJ-2 \nEnclosure J \n \ne.  Joint Manpower Change Requests.  All changes to manpower and \npersonnel requirements will be made effective at least 12 to 18 months from \nthe documentation of the implementer.  The changes must first enter the \nArmy\u2019s manpower system to allow visibility of changes in requirements.  For \nexample, the FY 2004 changes made to Army documents in October 2003 will \nhave an effective date of September 2004.  The Army converted from two \nmanpower change windows to one per year.  Given the uniqueness of joint \nactivities, the Army will continue to provide two manpower change updates to \nthe joint community per year\u2014February\u2013April and August\u2013October. \n3.  Navy Manpower and Personnel Process.  The joint manpower actions \nreflected in the new JTD are updated to the Total Force Manpower \nManagement System (TFMMS), which then flows automatically to the Navy \nPersonnel Command, where the data is used in the assignment process.  \nSpecifics follow: \n \na.  Activity Manpower Document (AMD) Update.  The AMD lists all Navy \nrequirements and authorizations with position-level detail by current year \nthrough the FYDP. \n \n \n(1)  The AMD is prepared and updated by the Navy joint position writers \nusing TFMMS. \n \n \n(2)  Manpower changes are received from the Joint Staff to the Navy \nwith a 30-day response time.  Navy manpower analysts review changes and \nforward uncompensated changes to the appropriate subject-matter experts \n(functionals) for coordination.  Uncompensated changes consist of upgrade and \nskill (designator/rate) changes.  Navy\u2019s guideline for skill changes can be \nreviewed in OPNAVINST 1000.16.  Additional information to assist Combatant \nCommands in planning manpower changes can be found at the following Web \nsite:  U.S. Navy, BUPERS Online, AMD access, <https://www.bol.navy.mil> \n(NIPRnet\u2014accessed 1 February 2014)  \n(reference ag). \n \n \n(3)  TFMMS is usually updated within 30 days of receipt of the JTD \nimplementer. \n \nb.  Navy Personnel Command.  TFMMS changes flow to the Navy Personnel \nCommand and are used to support a weekly update of the Navy\u2019s personnel \nassignment systems for the Officer Assignment Information System (OAIS) and \nbiweekly for the Enlisted Assignment Information System (EAIS). \n \n \n(1)  OAIS/EAIS is used by the individual career detailers to identify valid \nauthorizations requiring fill. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nJ-3 \nEnclosure J \n \n \n(2)  Detailers normally program assignment actions with a 9- to 12-\nmonth lead time.  The lead time varies depending on the position requirements, \nthe individual\u2019s current assignment, the deployment schedule of his or her \ncurrent command, and en route training required. \n \nc.  Normal Processing and Lead Times.  The Navy Manpower and Personnel \nprocess normally can produce a fill for a new or changed position within 9 to \n12 months from the TFMMS update.  Delays may be encountered when the \nchanges involve critically short skills or when changes in skill mix are made to \nan incumbent position (the position will not be filled until the incumbent \ndeparts). \n4.  Air Force Manpower and Personnel Process.  HQ U.S. Air Force/Directorate \nof Manpower, Organization and Resources (AF/A1M) is the joint organizations' \nentry point for changes to Air Force manpower requirements.  AF/A1M is the \nAir Force program element manager for programmed end strength (military and \ncivilian) allocated to joint organizations by OSD and is the focal point for \nimplementing the manpower requirements in the Air Force Manpower \nProgramming and Execution System (MPES) and Unit Manning Document \n(UMD). \n \na.  MPES.  MPES is the program of record for all required and authorized \nmanpower.  \u201cRequired\u201d is what is needed to perform a given mission with low \nrisk, and \u201cauthorized\u201d is what is needed to perform a given mission within an \nacceptable level of risk.  Only the authorized manpower is visible to Air Force \nassignment teams.  On a weekly basis, the manpower data files refresh the \npersonnel data files used by the Air Force assignment teams and military \npersonnel offices. \n \nb.  UMD.  A Unit Manning Document (UMD) is created for each joint \norganization from the data files in MPES.  The UMD lists all manpower \nrequirements for the current year and 5 years prior and 5 out years. \n \nc.  Manpower Authorization Changes.  Air Force manpower data system \nallows for changes to requirements projected years out.  Except for \u201cautomatic\u201d \nchanges, the effective date for changes will be projected at a minimum of 6 \nmonths out.  This allows the assignment process to react to the change and \nprovide Airmen acceptable minimum assignment selection notice. \n \nd.  Personnel Assignment Actions.  The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) \nhandles O-5/E-8 and below assignments; AF/DPE, E-9 assignments; AF/DPO, \nO-6 assignments; and AF/DPG, O-7 and above assignments. \n \n \n(1)  Organizations are responsible for communicating their manning \nrequirements via requisitions to AFPC or the annual colonel\u2019s game plan.  \nThese requests should include all details and both mandatory and desired \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nJ-4 \nEnclosure J \nrequirements (e.g., top secret clearance mandatory, joint duty assignment\u2014\ncritical, critical PRP required, foreign language skills, school requirements, \netc.). \n \n \n(2)  In a macro sense, the Air Force assignment systems operate on \ncycles, the numbers of which depend on the grades:  for officers in grade O-5 \nand below, three cycles per year; for enlisted E-9s and below, four cycles per \nyear; and for O-6s, including O-6 selects, annually (late summer/early fall each \nyear). \ne.  Normal Processing and Lead Times.  Although the UMD can be updated \nat any time, the effective date of a change will normally be 7-10 months out \nfrom the date of the Joint Staff implementer.  Whether and when Air Force can \nprovide actual fills for positions depends on the inventory available in the skill \nand at the grade authorized.  Air Force fills manpower requisitions according to \na command entitlement for specific skill by grade. \n \n5.  Marine Corps Manpower and Personnel Process.  The Deputy Commandant, \nCombat Development and Integration (DC CD&I), in the role of Total Force \nStructure Process Owner (TFSPO) manages Marine Corps total force structure \nand, specifically, two critical components of the Marine Corps\u2019 manpower \nprocess:  the Total Forces Structure Management System (TFSMS) and the \nAuthorized Strength Report (ASR).  The resulting process determines what \nrequirements will be funded and which positions will be manned. \n \n \na.  Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS)  \n \n \n \n(1)  TFSMS contains the unconstrained Marine Corps manpower \nrequirements for the current staffing year and the following 6 out years. \n \n \n \n(2)  TFSMS is updated on a continual basis as approved changes are \nreceived, but these updates become official only after review and semiannual \npublication of the ASR each February and August. \n \n \n \n(3)  Personnel requisitions flow solely from the official TFSMS. \n \n \nb.  Authorized Strength Report (ASR).  TFSMS allocates the estimated or \nauthorized Marine Corps end strength (not the actual personnel inventory), \nagainst all active and reserve manpower requirements (force structure) \ncaptured in TFSMS.  This process, known as \u201cmanning,\u201d occurs within the ASR \nand is a reflection of how many billets the Marine Corps can afford to \u201cbuy.\u201d  \nThe ASR allocates manning based on the individual grades and Military \nOccupational Specialties (MOS) required. \n \n \n \n(1)  The ASR represents an ideal solution, and the results of this process \nare published semiannually for the current year, and the following 6 out-years. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nJ-5 \nEnclosure J \n \n \n \n(2)  The most recently published ASR is used to compare current, \nassignable military inventory with the authorized requirement to prepare \nstaffing goals.  The ASR is simultaneously used in developing future military \nmanpower inventory. \n \n \nc.  Staffing Goal.  The Deputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve \nAffairs, applies the actual available inventory against the allocated manning \nlevels in the ASR to determine the number of personnel for assignment to each \nunit. \n \n \n \n(1)  The staffing goal drives the position requisitions employed by the \nMarine Corps personnel center. \n \n \n \n(2)  The Marine Corps staffing goal is updated on a semiannual basis to \naccount for changes in inventory and assignment policy.  However, the \nallocated manning in the ASR is updated only once a year for officers and twice \na year for enlisted. \n \n \n \n(3)  A Marine can be expected to arrive within 6 months of a staffing goal \nupdate unless the position incumbent is still on station.  In that case, when the \nincumbent departs, the replacement will be a Marine of the requested grade \nand skill. \n \n \nd.  Joint Manpower Change Requests.

Introduction.  The six Reserve Components (RCs) of the Department of \nDefense are codified in the same laws, primarily titles 10 and 32, United States \nCode (U.S.C.).  However, management of each of those RCs may vary among \nthe Military Services.  \n2.  Selected Reserve (SelRes) Augmentation.  SelRes augmentation can be in \nthe form of individual mobilization augmentees (IMAs) or SelRes units. \n \na.  IMAs.  IMA authorizations are individual military manpower positions \nidentified as necessary to augment the Active Component (AC) structure of the \nDepartment of Defense or other U.S. Government departments or agencies to \nsupport mobilization (including premobilization and/or post-mobilization) \nrequirements, contingency operations, operations other than war, or other \nspecialized or technical requirements.  IMAs are SelRes members of the Ready \nReserve who fill those authorized IMA positions. \n \n \n(1)  IMA use and management are outlined in reference g. \n \n \n(2)  IMA training requirements are as follows: \n \n \n \n(a)  Annual Training (AT).  IMAs must perform, as a minimum, 12 \ndays of AT per year. \n \n \n \n(b)  Inactive Duty Training (IDT).  As members of the SelRes in the \nReady Reserve, many IMAs are authorized to perform IDT.  Dependent upon \nthe position, authorized IDT periods may vary from 0 to 48 drill periods per \nyear. \n \n \n(3)  IMAs may be administratively formed into detachments for ease of \nmanagement and training.  However, these detachments will cease to exist \nwhen all members assigned to those detachments are mobilized by the \nCombatant Command. \n \nb.  SelRes Units.  These units are manned and equipped to serve and/or \ntrain either as operational units or as augmentation units.  Members of SelRes \nunits have a training requirement of a minimum of 14 days of AT and 48 \nscheduled drills each year per reference h. \n \n \n(1)  Operational Units.  Train and serve as units. \n \n \n(2)  Augmentation Units.  Train together, but when mobilized, lose their \nidentity and members become part of AC units. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nK-2 \nEnclosure K \n3.  SelRes Requirements Determination.  The Joint Staff and Combatant \nCommand headquarters and subordinate activities are authorized SelRes to \nsupport augmentation requirements. \n \na.  Joint activities should determine and document their total wartime \nworkload, including all wartime missions and peacetime missions that \ncontinue during a war or contingency. \n \nb.  Joint activities should determine their capability to meet their total \nwartime workload by assuming that all active duty requirements and civilian \nfull-time equivalents will be filled and that each incumbent will work 60 hours \nper week on the wartime workload and any peacetime workload that continues \nduring a war or contingency. \n \nc.  Any remaining workload forms the basis for requesting SelRes \nrequirements, if the remaining workload is determined to be military essential. \n \nd.  If additional RC requirements are needed, requests will follow the RDP \nprocedures set forth in Enclosure F. \n4.  Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) and Full-Time Support (FTS) Personnel.  \nReference i lists policy for use of AGR and FTS personnel.  AGR and FTS \npersonnel are serving voluntarily on Active Duty Other than for Training or \nFull-Time National Guard Duty.  AGR and FTS personnel are referred to as \nfollows: \n \na.  Army Reserve and Army National Guard AGR personnel. \n \nb.  Navy Full-Time Support personnel and canvasser/recruiters. \n \nc.  Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard AGR personnel. \n \nd.  Marine Corps Active Reserve (AR) personnel. \n \ne.  Coast Guard Reserve Program Administrator (RPA) personnel. \n5.  Guidelines for AGR and FTS Positions \n \na.  AGR and FTS positions should support the effective integration of RC \nassets into the organization. \n \nb.  AGR and FTS authorizations should not be requested to circumvent \nlimitations on management HQ activities or personnel end strength ceilings. \n6.  JTMD.  The JTMD identifies the additional manpower and organization \nrequired to shift to a wartime, contingency, or mobilization footing.  Although \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nK-3 \nEnclosure K \nSelRes requirements are listed on the JTMD, all AGR/FTS requirements are \nlisted on the JTD. \n \na.  Like the JTD, the JTMD requirements are defined by activity, PEC, and \ncategory. \n \nb.  JTMDs also indicate the drilling category of the augmentee.  In turn, the \ncategory determines the peacetime level of Reserve training and sourcing. \n \nc.  Augmentation requirements must be coordinated with the applicable \nServices and RCs for funding approval and sourcing. \n \nd.  The DoD code on the JTMD shows precisely where the position will be \nused during mobilization.  For example, if an O-4 logistician will be a member \nof the watch section in the Logistic Readiness Center in USTRANSCOM during \nmobilization, then that position will be assigned the same DoD code within the \nLogistics Readiness Center. \n \ne.  Since the JTMD is an extension of the JTD, it should be reviewed \nroutinely to ensure that it reflects: \n \n \n(1)  Mobilization needs of the organization. \n \n \n(2)  The organization of the current JTD. \n \nf.  The JTD and JTMD can be set up either as a combined database and \nprintout or as two separate documents.  Figure D-3 is an example of the \ncombined JTD and JTMD format. \n7.  Reserve Support to Joint Activities.  Besides AT and IDT, the following active \nduty programs may be used to support or augment joint activities: \n \na.  Active Duty for Training (ADT).  A category of active duty used to provide \nstructured individual and/or unit readiness training or educational courses to \nRC members.  ADT may support AC missions and requirements (i.e., \noperational support), thereby adding substance to the Total Force. \n \nb.  Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS).  Authorized voluntary AD for \nRC personnel appropriations (ADOS-AC funded or ADOS-RC funded) to \nsupport AC or RC programs, respectively.  The purpose of ADOS is to provide \nthe necessary skilled manpower assets to support existing or emerging \nrequirements.  Authorization of ADOS shall be managed pursuant to Issuances \nestablished by the Service Secretary concerned.  Management of ADOS tours \nshould be in accordance with DoDI 1215.06, paragraph 6.1.4.2.1. \n \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nK-4 \nEnclosure K \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(INTENTIONALLY BLANK) \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-1 \nEnclosure L \nENCLOSURE L \n \nU.S. MANPOWER FOR NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) \nMILITARY COMMANDS AND AGENCIES \nMAJOR FORCE PROGRAM TEN \n \n1.

The Office of the USNMR SHAPE and U.S. National Liaison \nRepresentative (USNLR) Supreme Allied Command Transformation are \nresponsible for the following: \n \n \n(1)  USNMR provides liaison among SHAPE, the Department of Defense, \nand supporting agencies. \n \n \n(2)  USNLR, similarly to USNMR, provides liaison among ACT, the \nDepartment of Defense, and supporting agencies. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-2 \nEnclosure L \n \n \n(3)  Advising Joint Staff and USEUCOM (ECJ1) on which manpower and \npersonnel policy issues warrant attention and recommending a course of \naction, as necessary. \n \n \n(4)  Distributing NATO documents and manpower requests to \nUSDELMC, Joint Staff, and ECJ1 and providing copies of U.S. responses to \nACO and ACT, as required. \n \n \n(5)  Monitoring manpower requests to ensure compliance with the basic \npolicy guidelines stated herein as well as Allied Administrative Publication \n(AAP) 16, [NATO] Manpower Policy and Procedures (reference j). \n \nNote:  ECJ1 is the U.S.-designated lead/executive agent for negotiating, \nconcluding, and changing U.S. contributions to NATO multinational MOU \norganizations.  ECJ1 submits proposed U.S. contributions directly to the Joint \nStaff in conjunction with the proposed MOU submissions. \n \nb.  The USMILREP NATO MC is responsible for: \n \n \n(1)  Representing the United States day to day in the NATO Defense \nManpower Committee (NDMC) and working groups. \n(2)  Advising Joint Staff on which manpower and personnel policy \nissues warrant attention and recommending a course of action, as necessary. \n \n \n(3)  Acting as the primary liaison between ECJ1 and HQ NATO on \nmatters regarding the U.S. manpower and personnel contribution to the \nInternational Military Staff (IMS) and its associated agencies, as depicted in the \nU.S. Element JMP.  Additionally, working with ECJ1 on U.S. manpower and \npersonnel requirements for the U.S. Delegation to the Military Committee \n(USDELMC) and USNMR.  Further details concerning USDELMC mission and \nfunctions are detailed in Joint Staff Manual 5100.01. \n \nc.  ECJ1 performs Combatant Command-level manpower and personnel \nfunctions for U.S. contributions to NATO in accordance with reference l, which \noutlines specific responsibilities. \n \nd.  Joint Staff J-1/HCD will perform Joint Staff-level manpower and \nmanning functions for NATO and is responsible for coordinating NATO JTD \nchanges with the Services, Joint Staff, and OSD, as required, and \nimplementing approved changes.  J-1/HCD also manages joint manpower \nresources allocated for NATO in the DoD FYDP and ensures NATO manpower \nresource issues are incorporated and considered in the annual OSD PBR.   \nJ-1/HCD is also responsible for representing the United States in the NATO \nDefense Manpower Committee (NDMC) at its semiannual meetings and \ndeveloping coordinated U.S. position on NDMC manpower policies and change \nproposals. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-3 \nEnclosure L \n3.  U.S. Manpower Contribution Validation Process \n \na.  General \n \n \n(1)  Reference j covers NATO manpower policies and procedures agreed \nto by the United States. \n \n \n(2)  The peacetime establishment (PE) and MOU manpower annexes are \nrequirements documents that reflect organizational structure and manpower \nrequirements by duty title, nation, environment (maritime, land, air), or Service \ngrade, and remarks.  Post (manpower requirement) numbers are assigned by \ncommand and functional area for identification. \n \n \n(3)  Nation, grade, category, and Service give recapitulations by major \nfunctional areas and organizational elements. \n \n \n(4)  NATO grades are reflected as OF (officer) or OR (other ranks) \ncategory.  NATO OF grades correspond to U.S. next higher grade (e.g., NATO \ngrade OF-5 is U.S. grade O-6).  NATO OR grades are equivalent to U.S. enlisted \ngrades (e.g., an OR-5 is an E-5). \n \n \n(5)  New U.S.-authorized manpower normally will not be approved \nwithout identification and deletion of an equal number of same-Service, same-\ngrade offsets. \n \n \n(6)  Once the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff accepts the PEs and \nMOUs, with Service concurrence, the manpower authorizations on the \napproved NATO JTD will be matched in the Service manpower and personnel \nsystems and filled by the Services accordingly. \n \n \n(7)  NATO manpower documents contain insufficient position \ninformation data to support U.S. personnel assignment needs.  To compensate \nfor this deficiency, the U.S. representatives to the respective \ncommands/agencies must submit full NATO job descriptions to ECJ1 \nconcurrent with submission of proposed PEs and MOUs of new organizations \nand proposed manpower changes to existing PEs and MOUs. \n \n \n(8)  GO/FO support staff.  U.S. personal support posts for U.S. GO/FOs \nauthorized for NATO activities are sometimes carried on the PE or MOU and \nincluded as part of the U.S. contribution.  In other cases, U.S. personal staff \nmembers are allocated by the Services to support GO/FO positions, are not \npart of the U.S. contribution, and are not included on the PE or MOU.  GO/FO \nsupport manpower must be considered on a case-by-case basis. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-4 \nEnclosure L \n \n \n(9)  Dual-status posts \n \n \n \n(a)  Certain U.S. personnel are assigned dual-status posts in more \nthan one NATO organization (\u201ctwinned post\u201d by NATO definition). \n \n \n \n(b)  Other U.S. personnel assigned to a NATO post have dual status \nin U.S. national position (\u201cdual-hatted\u201d post by NATO definition). \n \n \n \n(c)  Dual-status posts are identified and annotated in the \norganizational documents of both organizations.  The \u201cdual-hatted\u201d post (by \nNATO definition) is funded in the authorization document of the organization to \nwhich they are primarily responsible to preclude double counting the \nauthorization. \n \nb.  Review and Approval of PEs and MOUs \n \n \n(1)  After Service coordination, the Secretary of Defense, through the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will approve U.S. support of the PEs and \nMOUs. \n \n \n(2)  Changes to approved U.S. Service totals, Service category (officer \nand enlisted), and changes involving manpower from more than one U.S. \nService or U.S. officer positions (O-6 and below/\u201dnations-to-post\u201d) will be \ndistributed as follows: \n \n \n \n(a)  ACO, NAEW&C, NCIA through USDELMC Registry to ECJ1 and \nJoint Staff J-1. \n \n \n \n(b)  ACT through USDELMC Registry to ECJ1 and Joint Staff J-1. \n \n \n \n(c)  International military activities, NATO MC through USDELMC \nRegistry to ECJ1 and Joint Staff J-1. \n \n \n \n(d)  Multinational MOU organizations through ECJ1, in conjunction \nwith MOU approval, to Joint Staff J-1. \n \n \n(3)  Changes will be processed thru ECJ1 and reviewed by Joint Staff  \nJ-1, which will forward them to the Services for approval. \n \n \n(4)  \u201cAutomatic\u201d changes that do not affect Service totals, Service \ncategory, and U.S. officer positions O-6 and below, or that involve manpower \nfrom only one Service, do not require CJCS approval and will be distributed \nthrough USDELMC Registry to ECJ1 and Joint Staff J-1.  Any change not in \nconjunction with a regular PE or MOU will be submitted as an out-of-cycle \nchange. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-5 \nEnclosure L \n \n \n(5)  The Special Assistant for GO/FO Matters, Joint Staff, handles \nGO/FO \u201cflags-to-post\u201d positions, in coordination with Joint Staff J-5. \n \nc.  NATO Command Structure (NCS) restructuring. \n \n \n(1)  The NCS consists of NATO\u2019s two strategic commands, ACO and \nACT. \n \n \n(2)  NATO Process:  NATO transforms the NCS to meet the military \nneeds of the Alliance through periodic restructuring.  The process is outlined in \nAAP 16 and consists of four main phases: \n \n \n \n(a)  Functional Review.  Each peacetime establishment authority \n(PEA) completes a thorough manpower review to support the restructuring.  \nEach PEA is required to provide updated position descriptions (PDs) for every \npost in the structure. \n \n \n \n(b)  Outline PE:  establishes the organizational structure of each HQ \ndown to branch level. \n \n \n \n(c)  Initial State Peacetime Establishment (ISPE):  Based on the \nresults of the functional review, the PEA prepares the ISPE, which is \ndistributed to each of the NATO nations.  The ISPE provides the minimum post \nline level manpower detail to support the structure determined in the \nfunctional review.  The PEA will additionally provide the post descriptions with \nthe ISPE. \n \n \n \n(d)  End State Peacetime Establishment (ESPE):  The final NATO \nmanpower document provided to each nation upon completion of the bidding \nprocess.  The ESPEs identify the nation responsible for filling each post. \n \n \n(3)  U.S. Process:  During any NATO restructuring, the United States \nmust conduct a parallel process to that followed by NATO with the aim of \nredistributing U.S. manpower authorizations to the new or changed NCS \nmanpower requirements.  The U.S. process must keep pace with the NATO \nprocess.  General U.S. guidelines for PE changes/restructuring are as follows, \nfollowed by illustrative diagrams: \n \n \n \n(a)  Effectiveness \n \n \n \n \n1.  Focus on military effectiveness. \n \n \n \n \n2.  Limit rotational posts to only those absolutely necessary. \n \n \n \n(b)  Influence \n \n \n \n \n1.

In commands where the United States does not have GO/FO \nposts, consider an O-6 in Operations. \n \n \n \n(c)  Manpower affordability \n \n \n \n \n1.  No overall increase in the U.S. manpower contribution to \nNATO without Service concurrence. \n \n \n \n \n2.  No growth in U.S. Service-specific contributions without \nService concurrence. \n \n \n \n \n3.  Work toward more jointness across the NATO Command \nStructure (can shift Service manpower between strategic commands). \n \n \n \n(d)  Personnel supportability.  The United States cannot accept new \nmanpower requirements in shortage/stressed skills or rated positions without \nidentification of offset(s) without Service concurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nL-7 \nEnclosure L \n    \n   \nFigure L-1.

As joint activities, U.S. representatives to NATO should \ndetermine their augmentation requirements in accordance with Enclosure K. \n \n \n(3)  The United States may support exercises with manpower \nrequirements stated in the NATO JTMD, subject to the following conditions:   \nAll qualified JTD manpower must be identified for the exercise before additional \nU.S. augmentee requirements will be supported.  U.S. augmentation above the \nU.S.-approved JTD will depend primarily on the availability of RC manpower \nresources. \n4.  Nominations for NATO Non-Quota (NQ) Posts \n \na.  Requests from NATO for nominations for NQ posts are forwarded to \nECJ1 through the appropriate U.S. representative, who may provide a \nrecommendation to ECJ1 on whether or not the United States should nominate \nsomeone to fill the position. \n \nb.  In order to successfully staff a nomination request, a minimum 2-month \nlead time is required for nominations, with a fill date generally no less than 6 \nmonths from the date of selection.  A recommendation from the USMILREP for \nthe NATO command requesting nominations is also important for success.  \nThis does not preclude forwarding a request to nominate with less than a 2-\nmonth lead time; however, less time to staff the action would greatly diminish \nthe likelihood of support. \n \nc.  Service nominations for NQ posts should include an appropriate \nmanpower resource strategy. \n \nd.  Special USDELMC procedures for IMS NQ posts are as follows: \n \n \n(1)  In accordance with reference j, the IMS will announce IMS NQ posts \nfor which nominations are invited.

Introduction.  The fundamental legal basis for the National \nIntelligence Program (NIP) is reference n, which outlines specific roles \nand responsibilities of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the \nmajor components of the Intelligence Community (IC).  References x and \ny, respectively, prescribe the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence (USD(I)) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). \n2.  Relationship to the DNI.  All national intelligence activities are \nconsolidated in the NIP under the cognizance of the DNI.  Reference n \narticulates the DNI\u2019s roles and responsibilities and the major \norganizations funded under the NIP.  It also outlines criteria used to \nassign a program to the NIP.  The Program Manager of each NIP program \ndevelops the program and budget submission as an input to the NIP, \nparticipates in the NIP approval process, and oversees execution of funds \nappropriated for NIP-funded operations and activities. \n3.  Relationship to the USD(I).  All military intelligence activities are \nconsolidated into the MIP under the cognizance of the USD(I).  \nReferences x and y articulate the roles and responsibilities of the USD(I) \nand the major organizations funded under the MIP and outline criteria \nused to assign a program to the MIP.

Introduction.  U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is \ncharged by legislation and guidance to ensure adequate manning, \ntraining, resourcing, modernization, and readiness of all special \noperations forces (SOF) in support of the National Command Authority \nand all theater commanders in pursuit of national objectives around the \nglobe.  USSOCOM has both Commander (CDR) responsibilities as well as \nprogram and budget authority for Major Force Program (MFP) 11.  This \nauthority or responsibility allows CDR, USSOCOM, to program and \nbudget SOF programs, structure, and associated manpower end \nstrength.  USSOCOM has both joint and Service organizations that are \nrequired to be resourced through MFP-11.  For the OSD staff, the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense (Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict \n(ASD(SO/LIC)) provides overall supervision, including policy and \nresources oversight under reference q. \n2.  Activities Concerned.  MFP-11 activities include U.S. special \noperations, psychological operations, and civil affairs forces.  In addition, \nit includes USSOCOM, its Service Components, assigned joint \norganizations, and theater commander special operations commands \n(SOCs).  The manpower associated with these MFP-11 activities, which \ninclude Service-specific and joint positions, are planned, programmed, \nand budgeted by USSOCOM. \n3.  Statutory Basis.  Reference r provides CDR, USSOCOM, with the \nresponsibility and authority to validate requirements, determine \npriorities, and submit to the Secretary of Defense program \nrecommendations and budget proposals for all MFP-11 forces. \n4.  Planning and Programming.  The Secretary of Defense approves \nUSSOCOM MFP-11 funding requests.  The Services will be afforded the \nopportunity to review and comment on all USSOCOM manpower \nauthorization changes to facilitate preparation of their personnel \nmanning plans, POM, and budget. \n5.  Cycles and Approving Authority.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff is the approving authority for all joint manpower and associated \ndocuments.  These manpower documents are coordinated with the \nServices to determine their ability to support required grades and \nspecialties.  USSOCOM considers both joint and Service-specific \nmanpower requests from MFP-11 funded activities and recommends \nauthorized manpower levels to the Secretary of Defense during \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nO-2 \nEnclosure O \ndevelopment of the POM.  Geographic CDRs inform USSOCOM of \nunfunded manpower requirements through their IPL. \n6.  USSOCOM Procedures \n \na.  In 1989, the Secretary of Defense granted CDR, USSOCOM, \nprogramming and budget authority for MFP-11. \n \nb.  The following procedures apply to MFP-11 manpower \nprogramming and budgeting procedures: \n \n \n(1)  The Secretary of Defense accepts both MFP-11 and the \nServices\u2019 end strength in the POM, adding them together to determine \nthe total Service end strength to be forwarded to Congress in the PB.  \nCongress sets new Service end strength each year, which includes  \nMFP-11. \n \n \n(2)  Changes to end strength and ceilings are normally not \npermitted after the POM.  The Services must budget the end strength \nspecified in the POM when directed by resource management decision \n(RMD).  MFP-11 manpower changes not budgeted can be accommodated \nonly via internal realignment and with compensation in accordance with \nService personnel policy. \n \nc.  The authority to acquire MFP-11 manpower does not relieve \nUSSOCOM from complying with accepted manpower management \nprinciples, objectives, ceilings, and constraints.  USSOCOM will \ncoordinate its future MFP-11 manpower requirements with the Services \nto ensure support of requisite grade and/or skills and to determine \nService-specific training and/or personnel requirements for the POM \nacross the FYDP.  Manpower shortfalls stemming from this process will \nbe resolved during the RMD cycle of the budgetary review. \n \nd.  In order to meet new or emerging requirements, USSOCOM will \nmake every effort to cross-level and source requirements from internal \nresources.  However, due to the limited number of authorized MFP-11 \njoint and Service positions, USSOCOM may convert MFP-11 Service \npositions to MFP-11 joint positions or the reverse. \n \ne.  New out-year joint authorizations will be acquired through the \nMFP-11 POM with OSD concurrence in coordination with the Services. \n7.  Programming of Theater SOC Manpower.  In accordance with the  \nFY 2013 Forces for Unified Commands memorandum, 11 February 2013, \nTheater SOCs realign themselves under USSOCOM.  Funding authority \nrests with USSOCOM, which will develop a balanced special operations \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nO-3 \nEnclosure O \nprogram that will include adequate and affordable manpower for the \nSOCs of the theater CDRs. \n8.  Management Headquarters Ceiling (MHC).  USSOCOM receives an \nMHC (separate from the Services\u2019 controlled ceiling) directly from the \nSecretary of Defense.  USSOCOM controls and allocates this ceiling for \nHQ, USSOCOM, and its Service Components. \n9.  Civilian Authorizations.  MFP-11 civilian authorizations are Defense \nagency civilians who are managed to budget and funded directly from \nUSSOCOM.  FYDP civilian levels are targets for CDRs that may be \nexceeded with USSOCOM approval only if a validated requirement exists.  \nAlthough USSOCOM-funded civilians are administered by the respective \nService\u2019s personnel system, control of the positions rests with \nUSSOCOM. \n10.  MFP-11 Service Distribution.  During the POM and budget \ndevelopment, USSOCOM will coordinate with the Services regarding the \ntotal number of joint MFP-11 positions required by Service and position \ncategory and the distribution of those positions among various joint \nMFP-11 activities.  However, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nmust concur with the activity distribution of these positions, and the \ntheater CDRs, if applicable, must coordinate proposed manpower \nchanges via JTD change to the Joint Staff. \n11.  Management of MFP-11 Resources.  USSOCOM has authority to \nmanage MFP-11 manpower resources.  Resources will be aligned, \nreduced, or programmed, as determined by CDR, USSOCOM, and \napproved by ASD(SO/LIC) and the Secretary of Defense. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nO-4 \nEnclosure O \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(INTENTIONALLY BLANK)\nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nP-1 \nEnclosure P \nENCLOSURE P \n \nDEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM MANPOWER  \nMAJOR FORCE PROGRAM EIGHT \n \n1.

Introduction.  The Secretary of Defense established the Defense Business \nOperations Fund (later changed to the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF)) \nin October 1991 under the authority of reference u.  It merged into a single \nfund the former stock and industrial funds and several activities previously \nfunded with direct appropriations.  The DWCF financial structure contains four \nworking capital funds:  Army WCF, Navy WCF, Air Force WCF, and the \nDefense-Wide WCF.  Its purpose is to improve the delivery of support services \nto the Department\u2019s operating forces while reducing the cost of operations.  The \nDWCF financial structure links cost and performance through total cost \nvisibility and full cost recovery. \n2.  Activities Concerned.  The Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) is \naligned as an activity group under the Air Force WCF.  The TWCF consists of \ncommon-user transportation functions of the following areas:  Military Surface \nDeployment and Distribution Command, Military Sealift Command, Air \nMobility Command, Defense Courier Center, and USTRANSCOM staff.  Major \nprograms supported are port operations, traffic management, sealift, and \nairlift. \n3.  General.  The TWCF is a revolving fund using a businesslike, buyer-seller \napproach.  Transportation customers establish requirements and are charged, \nthrough a rate structure, for the transportation services received.  The TWCF \nuses unit cost accounting to forecast and control costs and monitors monthly \nplans for key financial indicators such as cash, net operating results, and \naccounts receivable/payable against actual accounting data.  Unlike profit-\noriented commercial businesses, the TWCF strives to break even in prices \ncharged to customers.  Revenue from customers sustains the full cost and the \ncontinuous cycle of TWCF business operations. \n4.  Planning and Programming.  USTRANSCOM\u2019s TWCF budget submission is \nsubmitted to, and approved by, the USD(C).  CDR, USTRANSCOM, in a \nfiduciary role, works closely with the Military Departments (in their organize, \ntrain, and equip role) to optimize and properly size TWCF manpower levels.  \nUSTRANSCOM negotiates closely with the Services to ensure manpower is \nplanned, programmed, and made available for assignment to TWCF activities.  \nUSTRANSCOM reimburses the Military Departments for the cost of TWCF \nmilitary positions, and TWCF civilians are paid directly through the fund.  \nTWCF activities are responsible for managing within Service military end \nstrength ceilings. \nCJCSI 1001.01B \n7 October 2014 \n \n \nQ-2 \nEnclosure Q \n5.
