Purpose.  This instruction provides the Joint Staff with a framework Joint \nStaff managers can use to develop and implement a telework program that \nmeets the needs of their specific workforce and mission.  The instruction \npromotes (1) recruitment and retention of the best possible workforce;  \n(2) continued operations during emergency conditions; (3) reduced \nmanagement costs related to employee turnover and absenteeism; and  \n(4) enhanced work/life balance by allowing employees to better manage their \nwork and family obligations. \n \n2.  Superseded/Cancellation.  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction \n(CJCSI) 1035.01A, \u201cJoint Staff Telework Program,\u201d 14 December 2018, is \nsuperseded. \n \n3.  Applicability.  This instruction applies to all Office of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff (OCJCS) and Joint Staff civilian employees. \n \n4.  Policy \n \n \na.  All employees are encouraged to support the telework program.  OCJCS \nand Joint Staff leaders recognize that a well-managed telework program can \nprovide benefits including improved marketability (as a more competitive and \ninclusive employer); reduced commuting time that can contribute to an \nimproved work/life balance; cost savings in areas such as recruitment of \nemployees; and an improved continuity of operations (COOP) plan. \n \n \nUNCLASSIFIED \nCJCSI 1035.0lB \n12 February 2021 \nb. OCJCS and Joint Staff leaders support telework as a major element of \nefforts to reduce commuting time and costs that accrue to employees while \ncontinuing to effectively accomplish the mission. Telework further enhances \nJoint Staff efforts to employ and accommodate people with disabilities, reduces \nemployee transportation costs, and provides cost savings by decreasing the \nneed for office space and parking facilities. \nc. OCJCS and Joint Staff leadership and employees must work together to \nensure the telework program meets this intent without degradation to the \nOCJCS mission. \nd. This instruction recognizes and supports the need for improved \ncommunication between employees and management on all aspects of \napplicable telework arrangements. It also recognizes that employees and \nmanages are equally responsible for contributing to the success of telework. \n5. Definitions. See Glossary. \n6. Responsibilities. See Enclosure A. \n7.

Types of Telework.  Telework is an effective strategy for enhancing mission \naccomplishment, ensuring COOP during a crisis, and recruiting/retaining \nvalued talent (see reference f)  Additionally, telework can generate cost savings \nby decreasing the need for office space and parking facilities and reducing \ntransportation costs, including costs associated with payment of transit \nsubsidies or enhancement of workforce safety.  Finally, telework can help \nreduce traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy consumption.  \nThe various types of telework include the following: \n \n \na.  Regular and Recurring \n \n \n \n(1)  Work performed at an alternative worksite on a routine basis by an \nemployee who is approved to telework on a schedule that is regular and \nrecurring, most often on an agreed-upon day or days during a biweekly pay \nperiod. \n \n \n \n(2)  Eligible employees on regular and recurring agreements are allowed \nto telework a maximum of 1 day per week for no more than 2 days per pay \nperiod, except when ad-hoc telework requirements apply or an exception has \nbeen made as per Enclosure H, paragraph 1.c. \n \n \nb.

The criteria above shall be considered in making the \ndetermination to deny telework.  Denial or termination of telework agreements \nshould be based on business reasons (e.g., the telework agreement fails to meet \nthe organization\u2019s needs or the employee\u2019s performance does not meet the \nprescribed standard).  Telework may be considered after the employee\u2019s \nperformance within the first 6 months in the position or at mid-term review if \nat an acceptable level or their supervisor deems otherwise. \n \n \nc.  Employees may dispute the denial of telework, the reasons for denial, \nand the termination of an existing agreement through administrative grievance \nprocedures. \n \n \nUNCLASSIFIED \nCJCSI 1035.01B \n12 February 2021 \n \nC-3 \nEnclosure C \nUNCLASSIFIED \n \n \nd.

Employees are responsible and accountable for safeguarding all DoD \ninformation, protecting GFE and government property, and performing \nassigned duties while teleworking, in accordance with Title 5, Code of Federal \nRegulations (C.F.R.), part 2635.  The General Services Administration offers \nguidelines on the equipment and support that may be provided to teleworkers \nin Federal Register, Volume 71, page 13845, \u201cFederal Management Regulation; \nGuidelines for Alternative Workplace Arrangements\u201d (Federal Management \nRegulation Bulletin 2006-B3). \n \n \nb.  Employees must ensure appropriate security considerations are followed \nwhen accessing approved sensitive but unclassified information, or classified \nmaterial if equipped for remote SIPRNET use, at their telework sites.  \nAdditionally, employees: \n \n \n \n(1)  Must not access any sensitive but unclassified information, data, or \nmaterial otherwise restricted by statute or policy, such as the Privacy Act or \nHIPPA, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Defense Federal Acquisition \nRegulation Supplement, or other acquisition policies. \n \n \n \n(2)  Must comply with criteria and guidelines when using GFE and non-\nGFE for access to DoD information systems and networks to keep government \nproperty and information safe and secure when teleworking.  Employees do not \nhave any right to, or expectation of, privacy while using any GFE, including \nInternet or e-mail services, and may be monitored or recorded. \n \n2.  Equipment \n \n \na.  Within budgetary constraints and with the supervisor\u2019s approval, the \nJoint Staff may provide the necessary equipment and office supplies (e.g., \npaper, toner, and printer ink) for use with GFE for employees who telework on \na regular and recurring basis.  For those approved to telework on a situational \nbasis, equipment and supplies may be provided when practicable. \n \n \nb.

Telework Agreements.  The approval authorities for telework participation \nare the Vice Directors of the J-Dirs and the Deputy Director, DOM.  Further \ndelegation of approval authority is not authorized.  Supervisors of civilian \nemployees participating in the telework program are responsible for managing \nthe program, the workload, and timekeeping of their employees.  Telework \nagreements must be submitted to the J-1 Telework Program Manager. \n \n \na.  A completed DD Form 2946 (Enclosure D) should outline the specific \nwork arrangement agreed to and address the logistics of alternative worksite \narrangements, i.e., work schedule, security requirements, safety requirements, \nsupplies, equipment, supervisor\u2019s expectations, and the employee\u2019s emergency \nresponse telework responsibilities.  All agreements shall include the following: \n \n \n \n(1)  Specific telework location (e.g., the employee\u2019s residence or other \napproved alternative worksite). \n \n \n \n(2)  Requirements when the official duty station is closed or when OPM \nannounces Joint Staff offices in the employee\u2019s location are open with the \noption for unscheduled telework. \n \n \n \n(3)  Description of any specific information security requirements (such \nas encryption, storage, or transfer specifications applicable to the data type) \nneeded to ensure proper safeguards are in place to protect any sensitive but \nunclassified data that is authorized to be processed at the employee\u2019s telework \nlocation. \n \n \n \n(4)  A statement that telework may not be authorized if the employee\u2019s \nperformance and/or conduct does not comply with the terms of the telework \nagreement. \n \n \n \n(5)  If the employee\u2019s residence is the telework location, it is the \nresponsibility of the employee to ensure that a safe work environment is \nmaintained while teleworking.  The employees will designate one section of the \nresidence as the telework area, conduct a home safety inspection, and complete \nand sign a self-certification safety checklist (DD Form 2946, page 2) (Enclosure \nD) as part of the DoD Telework Agreement prior to beginning telework.  While \nthere is no requirement to visit a teleworker\u2019s home to inspect for safety and \nergonomics, a qualified management official may conduct a home inspection if \nUNCLASSIFIED \nCJCSI 1035.01B \n12 February 2021 \n \n \nH-2 \nEnclosure H \nUNCLASSIFIED \nnecessary.  The employee must execute a new agreement if the alternate work \nlocation changes. \n \n \n \n(6)  Telework agreements will be reviewed and revalidated by the Vice-\nDirector of each J-Dir, supervisor, and the teleworker every 2 years.  The \nagreement will be revised/initialed by all parties when appropriate (schedule \nchanges, site changes, etc.).  A new supervisor can re-evaluate an existing \ntelework agreement and agree with the current arrangement or reevaluate the \ntelework arrangement previously authorized. \n \n \n \n(7)  Teleworkers may be required to return to the official duty station on \nscheduled telework days if necessary (e.g., to attend a specific meeting).  \nRequests by teleworkers to change their scheduled telework day(s) shall remain \nconsistent with mission requirements and at the supervisor\u2019s discretion.  Any \npermanent changes require a new DoD Telework Agreement. \n \n \nb.  The official worksite for a telework employee is generally the location of \nthe official duty station (i.e., the place where the employee would normally \nwork absent a telework agreement).  This applies as long as the employee is \nscheduled to actually report, most often on an agreed-upon day or days during \na biweekly pay period, on a routine basis to the official duty station.  If an \nemployee covered by a telework agreement does not meet the requirements \nabove, the employee's official worksite is the location of the employee\u2019s telework \nsite. \n \n \nc.  Exceptions may be authorized in appropriate situations, such as when \nan employee is recovering from an injury or medical condition that prevents the \nemployee from commuting to the official duty station (see OPM\u2019s fact sheet for \nOfficial Duty Station location for pay purposes at \n<https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-\nadministration/fact-sheets/official-worksite-for-location-based-pay-\npurposes/>). \n \n \nd.  If an employee\u2019s official duty station is changed from the traditional \nworksite to a telework location in a permanent arrangement, a permanent \nchange in duty station must be documented with a Notification of Personnel \nAction (SF-50) and processed by the J-1 directorate.  Such an official change in \nduty station requires careful consideration of the impacts to mission and \nresourcing and will be documented by the supervisor completing and attaching \nenclosure I to the telework agreement.  Under no circumstance should a \npermanent change in duty station be approved solely for the convenience or \nfinancial gain of the employee.  Specific requirements must be included in the \nDoD Telework Agreement. \n \nUNCLASSIFIED \nCJCSI 1035.01B \n12 February 2021 \n \n \nH-3 \nEnclosure H \nUNCLASSIFIED \n \ne.  Employees are entitled to reimbursement for official travel to the official \nduty station when the employee teleworks full time from a location outside of \nthe local commuting area, and his or her alternative worksite is deemed the \nofficial duty station.  Employees who work full time from an alternative \nworksite designated as the official duty station and who do not report to the \ntraditional worksite at least 2 days per pay period are considered remote \nteleworkers.  Given the operational requirements of the Joint Staff, remote \ntelework is not authorized.  However, the Vice Director of each J-Dir or Deputy \nDirector, DOM may grant an exception to allow remote telework in exceptional \ncircumstances, not to exceed 6 months, as long as the conditions are clearly \nspelled out in the telework agreement and the performance standards are met \nper paragraph 7 of this enclosure.  Such employees are entitled to \nreimbursement for official travel to the traditional worksite. \n \n \nf.  Reassignment of the employee from the official duty station to the \ntelework site may have implications for a reduction in force (e.g., the telework \nsite may be a different competitive area than the official duty station). \n \n2.  Appropriate telework coding must be recorded on time and attendance \nrecords to capture the data used to help estimate reductions in greenhouse \nemissions resulting from increases in teleworking as required by Executive \nOrder 13514 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic \nPerformance). \n \n3.  Performance Management \n \n \na.  All employees should be treated the same, regardless of where the work \nis performed, for the purpose of work requirements, performance standards, \nappraisals, training, rewards, reassignment, promotion, reduction in grade, \nremoval, and any other action that requires management discretion. \n \n \nb.

If so, please \ndiscuss the differences in pay. \n \n2.  Will there be increased travel, \ntransportation, and per diem \nentitlements for the employee to \nreturn to the traditional worksite \nfrom the alternative worksite?  If so, \nplease discuss the projected annual \ncost to the Joint Staff. \n \n3.  Will there be an increase in \novertime as a result of required travel \nto the traditional worksite and return \nto the alternative worksite?  If so, \nplease discuss the projected annual \ncost to the Joint Staff. \n \n4.  Will there be costs associated with \ninstalling telephone lines in private \nresidence and paying monthly phone \ncharges for such lines, long-distance \ntelephone charges, and telephone \nusage charges (other than long \ndistance)?  If so, please detail the \nprojected annual cost to the Joint \nStaff. \n \nUNCLASSIFIED \nCJCSI 1035.01B \n12 February 2021 \n \nI-2 \nEnclosure I \nUNCLASSIFIED \n5.  Will there be increased costs of a \nportable seat versus a stationary \ndesktop seat?  Please discuss the \nprojected annual cost to the Joint \nStaff. \n \n6.
