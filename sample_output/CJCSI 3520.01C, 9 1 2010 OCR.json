This instruction directs specific joint mission-essential tasks \n(JMETs) to be performed by National Military Command System (NMCS) \ncommand center staffs and select nuclear command and control (NC2) battle \nstaffs and details use of Emergency Action Procedures of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff (EAP-CJCS) material in NC2 computer-based training \n(CBT) material.  It identifies the existing joint tasks contained in the Universal \nJoint Task List per reference a. \n \n2.  Cancellation.  CJCSI 3520.01B is hereby canceled and authorized for \ndestruction. \n \n3.  Applicability.  This instruction applies to the Joint Staff, combatant \ncommands, and organizations with national NC2 responsibilities. \n \n4.  Policy.  NMCS command centers with NC2 responsibilities will develop \ntraining programs that ensure NC2 command center staffs are trained in the \nspecific JMETs identified in this instruction.  The JMETs listed in this \ninstruction represent the minimum command center staff tasks supporting \nnational NC2 responsibilities.  Functional areas of NC2 include:  (1) Security \n \nCJCSI 3520.01C \n1 September 2010 \n2 \nProcedures/Actions, (2) Battle Staff/Command Center Operations, (3) Integrated \nTactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), (4) Conferencing, (5) Global \nStrike Operations, (6) Emergency Actions, (7) Communications, (8) Survivable \nMobile Command Center (SMCC) Operations, and (9) Command Center Training. \n \n5.  Definitions.  None. \n \n6.  Responsibilities   \n \n \na.  Joint Staff, J-3 (J-36 Nuclear Operations Division (NOD)) \n \n(1)  Conduct periodic reviews of this instruction and distribute changes \nas required. \n \n(2)  Approve the EAP-CJCS portions of NC2 computer-based lesson plans \naccomplished by USSTRATCOM and Defense agencies prior to distributing to \nNC2 command centers. \n \n(3)  Annually review NC2 CBT modules against deficiencies and trend \nanalysis noted from the Joint Staff\u2019s Staff Assessment Visit program and POLO \nHAT communications assessment program.  Coordinate findings and areas of \ninterest with USSTRATCOM Joint Forces Component Command \u2013 Global Strike \n(JFCC-GS) to determine if CBT modules can help address any negative trends.  \nPrepare an annual report based on the results of the annual review and \ndistribute to J-39 NOD, J-33 OT&E, and all other NC2 command centers.  \n \n(4)  Coordinate with USSTRATCOM JFCC-GS on any funding issues that \naffect the Joint Staff\u2019s NC2 CBT requirements defined in this CJCSI. \n \n(5)  If requested, send appropriate Joint Staff personnel to USSTRATCOM \nto validate CBT modules with developers.  The Joint Staff, J-36 NOD, will \nbudget and pay for the cost of this travel. \n \n \nb.  USSTRATCOM \n \n(1)  Structure CBT modules to meet the NC2 needs of NMCS command \ncenters, EAP-CJCS Volume IV commands, and non-EAP-CJCS Volume IV \ncommands (reference b).  Modules should address the functional areas listed in \nparagraph 4 as they apply to individual commands. \n \n(2)  Notify Joint Staff, J-36 NOD of any NC2 CBT funding shortfalls. \n \n(3)  Periodically solicit feedback from all users on NC2 CBT content and \neffectiveness.  Coordinate recommended changes with Joint Staff, J-36 NOD. \n \nCJCSI 3520.01C \n1 September 2010 \n3 \n(4)  Submit CBT content derived from EAP-CJCS to J-36 NOD for review \nand approval prior to distribution.  CBT modules with USSTRATCOM-unique \nprocedures developed only for internal USSTRATCOM use do not require review \nand approval by the Joint Staff.   \n \n(5)  CBT content will include all Level 1 and Level 2 tasks as outlined in \nreference c. \n \n(6)  Following CBT approval, distribute software to the following \norganizations, as requested. \n(a) USCENTCOM \n(b) USEUCOM \n(c) \nUSJFCOM \n(d) USNORTHCOM Special Activities \n(e) \nUSPACOM \n(f) \nUSAFRICOM \n(g) USSOCOM \n(h) USSOUTHCOM \n(i) \nUSSTRATCOM Global Operations Center and Airborne \nCommand Post \n(j) \nUSTRANSCOM \n(k) Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) Support Staff  \n(l) \nUSAFE Command Center \n(m) COMSTRATCOMM Wing One \n(n) NAOC  \n(o) USNORTHCOM MCCC \n(p) NMCC Operations Teams \n(q) Joint Staff/J-36 NOD  \n(r) \nNMCC Site-R \n \nCJCSI 3520.01C \n1 September 2010 \n4 \nc.  NMCS Command Centers, Combatant Commands, and \nCOMSTRATCOMM Wing One \n \n(1)  Ensure NC2 battle staffs are trained, at the minimum, to accomplish \nJoint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETL) listed in the Enclosure.  Non-EAP-CJCS \nVolume IV Command Centers should tailor the tasks listed in the Enclosure to \nthose applicable to their particular command.  Any questions about task \napplicability should be addressed with the Joint Staff/J-36 NOD. \n \n(2)  Report any failure of CBT hardware or software to USSTRATCOM,  \nJ-313.  Forward suggestions for improvement of CBT modules or this \ninstruction to J-36 NOD and USSTRATCOM JFCC-GS.   \n \n7.  Authorization.  The foundations of several CBT lessons are derived from \nEAP-CJCS.  As such, this paragraph serves as written authorization for \ncombatant commands with NC2 responsibilities to electronically copy EAP-\nCJCS Volumes I, IA, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VII Annex A for use in CBT lessons.  \nCopies may be obtained directly from the Joint Staff, J-36 NOD or from \nUSSTRATCOM, J-38.
